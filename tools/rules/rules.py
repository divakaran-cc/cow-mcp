# Phase 1: Lightweight task summary resource

        @mcp.tool()
        def fetch_tasks_suggestions(user_requirement: str, summary_string: str, ctx: Context | None = None) -> dict[str, Any]:
            
            """
            Resource for intelligent task suggestion based on user requirements.

            PURPOSE:
            - Analyze the user's requirement and generate a concise **summary string** that
            captures the intent in natural language (not bullet points, not verbatim input).
            - Use the summary string to query task suggestions via the Suggestions API.
            - Match suggested tasks with the user’s intent to prevent redundant or duplicate task creation.
            - Provide resumption options if partially developed tasks exist.

            SUMMARY STRING CREATION:
            - Always derive a clear, single-paragraph summary string from the user's input.
            - Convert it into a structured summary string that clearly outlines each step/task that must be performed.
            - Each part of the summary string should represent an atomic action that could later be mapped to an individual task.
            - The summary must express the intended goal in natural language.
            - This summary string is what will be passed to `fetch_rules_and_tasks_suggestions`.
            - Example:
                Input: "Create a rule to update CC workflow user actions that remain 'in progress' for more than one day.
                The process should first check if any workflow user actions are pending, meaning their status is still 'in progress'.
                If such actions exist and were assigned more than one day ago, they should be marked as completed. Finally,
                send a notification to the user informing them that their action has been automatically marked as completed after waiting for a long time."
                Summary: "Check for workflow user actions with status 'in progress'.
                If they were assigned more than one day ago, mark them as completed and notify the user about the auto-completion."

            DECISION LOGIC:
            - If **matching tasks** are found in the suggestions:
                * Present them to the user for selection.
                * Include explanation of purpose, description, and relevance.
            - If **no matching tasks** are found:
                * FALLBACK: Call `get_tasks_summary()` to provide a broader list of tasks for discovery.
                * Clearly inform the user that no direct match was found and present fallback results.

            AUTOMATIC WORKFLOW HANDLING:
            - Detect if suggested tasks are only intermediate steps (splitting, extraction, validation, processing).
            - If intermediate: automatically recommend additional tasks that can complete the workflow.
            - Never leave the user with incomplete workflows.
            - Ensure the final task suggestions always lead to actionable, consumable deliverables.

            MANDATORY FUNCTIONALITY:
            - Generate summary string from raw requirement.
            - Fetch task suggestions using this summary.
            - Validate suggestions and ensure workflow completeness.
            - If suggestions fail → fallback to `get_tasks_summary()`.
            - Always explain reasoning when no suggestions are found and why fallback is triggered.
            
            NEXT STEPS AFTER MATCH:
            - Once matching task suggestions are presented to the user:
                * Wait for user selection.
                * Once matching tasks are found, show to user with explanation before fetching full details using `tasks://details/{task_name}`.
                * For each selected task, fetch complete task details using `tasks://details/{task_name}`.
                * Provide the full description, input/output parameters, templates, and usage guidance.
            - Apply the same **workflow completeness enforcement** as in `get_tasks_summary`:
                * If the selected task is only an intermediate step, automatically recommend additional tasks to complete the workflow.
                * Ensure that the final set of tasks always produces actionable, consumable deliverables.

            DEDUPLICATION HANDLING:
            - The `fetch_rules_and_tasks_suggestions` API may return the same task name multiple times
            with different descriptions and purpose.
            - In such cases:
                * Consolidate results under a single task entry.
                * Merge or summarize all unique descriptions and purpose into one combined explanation.
                * Ensure the final presentation avoids duplicates while still capturing all variations.
            - Always prioritize clarity: the user should see only one task name, with a rich combined description
            that reflects all possible contexts.

        """
        PURPOSE:  
        - Create structured support tickets only after strict user review and explicit approval of all descriptions.  
        - Ticket creation MUST NOT occur without explicit user confirmation at every required step.  
        - Reduce user input errors and rework by ensuring clarity and completeness before ticket submission.

        MANDATORY CONDITIONS — NO STEP MAY BE SKIPPED OR BYPASSED:

        1. BEFORE TOOL ENTRY:  
        - The tool MUST generate a detailed, pre-filled plain-text description for the task or workflow.  
        - The user MUST review this description carefully.  
        - Ticket creation MUST be blocked until the user explicitly APPROVES this description.

        2. USER VERIFICATION:  
        - The user MUST be presented with the full pre-filled description.  
        - The user MUST either confirm its correctness or provide feedback for changes.  
        - The tool MUST update the description and priority per feedback and repeat this verification step as many times as needed.  
        - Skipping or auto-approving this step is strictly prohibited.

        3. FINAL APPROVAL & FORMATTING:  
        - After user approval of the plain text, the description MUST be converted into professional HTML format (bold headings, clear structure, spacing).  
        - The user MUST explicitly approve this final HTML-formatted description.  
        - The tool MUST block ticket creation until this final approval is given.  
        - Only the fully user-approved, HTML-formatted description MAY be used to create the support ticket.

        IMPORTANT:  
        **Under no circumstances shall the tool proceed to ticket creation without explicit user approval at all mandatory steps.**  
        The process must strictly enforce these approvals, preventing any premature or automatic ticket submissions.

        MANDATORY USER INPUTS:  
        - `subject` (str) — ticket title.  
        - `description` (str) — final user-approved, HTML-formatted description.  
        - `priority` (str) — ticket priority level.  
        **Valid values:** `"High"`, `"Medium"`, `"Low"` (case-sensitive).

        Attach a rule to a specific control in an assessment.

        🚨 CRITICAL EXECUTION BLOCKERS — DO NOT SKIP 🚨
        Before **any** part of this tool can run, five preconditions MUST be met:

        1. Control Verification:
        - You MUST verify the control exists in the assessment by calling `verify_control_in_assessment()`.
        - Verification must confirm the control is present, valid, and a leaf control.
        - If verification fails → STOP immediately. Do not proceed.

        2. Rule ID Resolution:
        - If `rule_id` is a valid UUID → proceed.
        - If `rule_id` is an alphabetic string → treat it as the rule name and resolve it to a UUID **using `fetch_cc_rule_by_name()`**.
        - If resolution fails or `rule_id` is still not a UUID after this step → STOP immediately.
        - Execution is STRICTLY PROHIBITED with a plain name.

        3. Rule Publish Validation:
        - You MUST check if the rule is published in ComplianceCow before proceeding.
        - If the rule is not published → STOP immediately.  
        - Published status is a hard requirement for attachment.

        4. Evidence Creation Acknowledgment:
        - Before proceeding, you MUST request confirmation from the user about `create_evidence`.
        - Ask: "Do you want to auto-generate evidence from the rule output? (default: True)"
        - Only proceed after the user explicitly acknowledges their choice.

        5. Override Acknowledgment:
        - If the control already has a rule attached, you MUST request user confirmation before overriding.
        - Ask: "This control already has a rule attached. Do you want to override it? (yes/no)"
        - Only proceed if the user explicitly confirms.

        RULE ATTACHMENT WORKFLOW:
        1. Perform control verification using `verify_control_in_assessment()` (MANDATORY).
        2. Resolve rule_id using the CRITICAL EXECUTION BLOCKERS above (use `fetch_cc_rule_by_name()` when needed).
        3. Validate that the rule is published in ComplianceCow.
        4. Confirm evidence creation preference from the user (acknowledgment REQUIRED).
        5. Check for existing rule attachments and request override acknowledgment if needed.
        6. Attach rule to control.
        7. Optionally create evidence for the control.

        ATTACHMENT OPTIONS:
        - create_evidence: Whether to create evidence along with rule attachment. 
        Must be confirmed by the user before proceeding.

        VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
        - Control must be verified and confirmed as a leaf control.
        - Rule must be published.
        - Rule ID must be a valid UUID.
        - Assessment and control must exist.
        - User must acknowledge override before replacing an existing rule.

        Args:
            rule_id: ID of the rule to attach (UUID). If an alphabetic string is provided, 
                    it MUST be resolved to a UUID using `fetch_cc_rule_by_name()` before the tool proceeds.
            assessment_name: Name of the assessment.
            control_id: ID of the control.
            create_evidence: Whether to create auto-generated evidence from the rule output (default: True).
                            ⚠️ MUST be confirmed by user acknowledgment before execution.

        Returns:

        Publish a rule to make it available for ComplianceCow system.

        CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES:
        - **MANDATORY: Check rule status to ensure rule is fully developed before publishing**
        - MUST FOLLOW THESE STEPS EXACTLY
        - DO NOT ASSUME OR SKIP ANY STEPS
        - APPLICATIONS FIRST, THEN RULE
        - WAIT FOR USER AT EACH STEP
        - NO SHORTCUTS OR BYPASSING ALLOWED

        RULE PUBLISHING HANDLING:

        WHEN TO USE:
        - After successful rule creation
        - User wants to make rule available for others
        - Rule has been tested and validated

        WORKFLOW (step-by-step with user confirmation):

        1. Fetch applications and check status
        - Call fetch_applications() to get available applications
        - Extract appTypes from ALL tasks in rule spec.tasks[].appTags.appType - MUST TAKE ALL THE TASKS APPTYPE AND REMOVE DUPLICATES - CRITICAL: DO NOT SKIP ANY TASK APPTYPES
        - Match ALL task appTypes with applications app_type to get application_class_name
        - Call check_applications_publish_status() for ALL matched applications

        2. Present consolidated applications with meaningful format
        Applications for your rule:
        [1] App Name | Type: xyz | Status: Published | Action: Republish
        [2] App Name | Type: abc | Status: Not Published | Action: Publish
        
        Select applications to publish: ___
        - MANDATORY: WAIT for user selection before proceeding to next step
        - DO NOT CONTINUE without explicit user input
        - BLOCK execution until user provides selection
        - STOP HERE: Cannot proceed to step 3 without user response
        - HALT WORKFLOW: Wait for user to select application numbers
        - NEVER SKIP THIS STEP: User must select applications first
        - ALWAYS ASK FOR SELECTION EVEN IF ALL APPLICATIONS ARE PUBLISHED

        3. Publish selected applications (BLOCKED until step 2 complete)
        - ENTRY REQUIREMENT: User selection from step 2 must be provided
        - PREREQUISITE CHECK: Verify user provided application numbers
        - CANNOT EXECUTE: Without completing step 2 user selection
        - Get user selection numbers
        - Call publish_application() for selected applications only
        - Inform user whether successfully published or not
        - CHECKPOINT: All applications must be published before rule steps

        4. Check rule publication status (APPLICATIONS MUST BE COMPLETE FIRST)
        - GATE KEEPER: Cannot proceed without application publishing completion
        - MANDATORY PREREQUISITE: All application steps finished
        - BLOCKED ACCESS: No rule operations until applications handled
        - Call check_rule_publish_status()
        - Check response valid field:
            - True = Already published
            - False = Not published

        5. Handle rule publishing based on status
        If valid=False (not published):
        - Show: "Rule is not published. Do you want to publish it? (yes/no)"
        - If yes: Proceed with publishing using current name
        
        If valid=True (already published):
        - Show: "Rule is already published. Choose option:"
            - [1] Republish with same name
            - [2] Publish with another name
        - Get user choice

        6. Handle alternative name logic
        If "another name" chosen:
            1. Ask: "Enter new rule name: ___"
            2. Call check_rule_publish_status(new_name)
            3. If name exists: "Name already exists. Choose option:"
                - [1] Use same name (republish)
                - [2] Enter another name
            4. If name available: Proceed with new name
            5. Keep checking until user chooses available name or decides to republish existing

        7. Final publication
        - Call publish_rule() with confirmed name
        - Inform user: "Published successfully" or "Publication failed"

        8. Rule Association:
            - Publishes the rule to make it available for control attachment
            - Ask user: "Do you want to attach this rule to a ComplianceCow control? (yes/no)"
            - If yes: Proceed to associate the rule with control and request assessment name and control alias from the user
            - If no: End workflow

        EXECUTION CONTROL MECHANISMS:
        - STEP GATE: Each step requires completion before next
        - USER GATE: Each step requires user input/confirmation
        - EXECUTION BLOCKER: No tool calls without user response
        - WORKFLOW ENFORCER: Steps cannot be skipped or assumed
        - SEQUENTIAL LOCK: Must complete in exact order

        # RULE CREATION WITH MANDATORY TASK EXECUTION

        ## Core Principle
        **Every task MUST be executed immediately after collecting its inputs, before moving to the next task.**

        ## Workflow for Each Task (Sequential Order)

        ### Step 1: Collect Inputs
        - Collect ALL required inputs for the current task
        - Use `collect_template_input()` for files/templates
        - Use `collect_parameter_input()` for parameters
        - Confirm each input with user

        ### Step 2: Configure Application (If Needed)
        **Check task's appType:**
        - If `appType = "nocredapp"` → Skip to Step 3
        - If `appType ≠ "nocredapp"` → Application REQUIRED:
        1. Call `get_applications_for_tag(appType)`
        2. Show user: existing applications OR configure new credentials
        3. User selects option
        4. Collect and confirm application config
        5. **Cannot proceed without application**

        ### Step 3: Execute Task (MANDATORY - CANNOT SKIP)
        **⛔ This step is REQUIRED before moving to next task:**
        1. Call `execute_task(task_name, inputs, application)`
        2. Call `fetch_execution_progress()` - show live progress
        3. Display ALL output files to user
        4. Store output file URLs for next task

        **If execution fails:**
        - Show errors to user
        - Let user correct inputs
        - Re-execute until successful

        ### Step 4: Proceed to Next Task
        - Use REAL outputs from executed task
        - Start Step 1 for next task

        ## Quick Check Before Next Task
        Ask yourself:
        - ✅ Did I execute the current task?
        - ✅ Did I show the output files to user?
        - ✅ Do I have the output URLs?

        **If NO to any → STOP and complete that step first**

        ## What NOT to Do ❌
        - ❌ Collect inputs for Task 2 before executing Task 1
        - ❌ Skip execution to "save time"
        - ❌ Say "we'll execute later"
        - ❌ Use dummy data instead of real execution
        - ❌ Skip application config for non-nocredapp tasks

        ## Correct Pattern ✅
        ```
        Task 1: Collect inputs → Configure app (if needed) → Execute → Show results
        Task 2: Collect inputs → Configure app (if needed) → Execute → Show results  
        Task 3: Collect inputs → Configure app (if needed) → Execute → Show results
        Complete rule
        ```

        ## Wrong Pattern ❌
        ```
        Task 1: Collect inputs
        Task 2: Collect inputs
        Task 3: Collect inputs
        [Try to execute all later] ← WRONG!
        ```

        ## Remember
        Think of it as a pipeline: water must flow through valve 1 before you can open valve 2.
        **Execution is not optional. It happens NOW, not later.**

    Resource containing minimal task information for initial selection.
    
    This tool is also used as a fallback resource when fetch_tasks_suggestions is disabled or does not return suitable matches, ensuring
    the user always has access to a broader list of available tasks for manual selection.

    This resource provides only the essential information needed for task selection:
    - Task name and display name
    - Brief description
    - Purpose and capabilities
    - Tags for categorization
    - Inputs/Outputs params with minimal details
    - Basic README summary

    Use this for initial task discovery and selection. Detailed information can be
    retrieved later using `tasks://details/{task_name}` for selected tasks only.

    AUTOMATIC OUTPUT ANALYSIS BY INTENTION:
    - MANDATORY: Analyze each task's output purpose and completion level during selection
    - IDENTIFY output intentions that require follow-up processing:
        * SPLITTING INTENTION: Outputs that divide data into separate categories → REQUIRE consolidation
        * EXTRACTION INTENTION: Outputs that pull raw data without formatting → REQUIRE transformation  
        * VALIDATION INTENTION: Outputs that check compliance without final reporting → REQUIRE analysis/reporting
        * PROCESSING INTENTION: Outputs that transform data but don't create final deliverables → REQUIRE finalization

    OUTPUT COMPLETION ASSESSMENT:
    - EVALUATE: Does this output serve as a final deliverable for end users?
    - ASSESS: Is this output consumable without additional processing?
    - DETERMINE: Does this output require combination with other outputs to be meaningful?
    - IDENTIFY: Is this output an intermediate step in a larger workflow?

    WORKFLOW COMPLETION ENFORCEMENT:
    - NEVER present task selections that end with intermediate processing outputs
    - AUTOMATICALLY suggest tasks that fulfill incomplete intentions
    - ENSURE every workflow produces actionable final deliverables
    - RECOMMEND tasks that bridge gaps between current outputs and user goals

    Mandatory functionality:
    - Retrieve a list of task summaries based on the user's request
    - Analyze task outputs and suggest additional tasks for workflow completion
    - If no matching task is found for the requested functionality, prompt user for confirmation
    - Based on user response, either proceed accordingly or create support ticket using create_support_ticket()

    COMPLETE TEMPLATE HANDLING PROCESS:

    STEP 1 - TEMPLATE IDENTIFICATION:
    - Called for inputs that have a templateFile property
    - Provides decoded template content and structure explanation
    - Returns required fields, format-specific tips, and validation rules

    PREFILLING PROCESS:
    1. Analyze template structure for external dependencies
    2. Prefill template with realistic values based on the instructions

    RELEVANCE FILTERING:
    - ANALYZE task description and user use case to create targeted search queries
    - EXTRACT key terms from rule purpose and task capabilities
    - COMBINE system name with specific functionality being configured
    - PRIORITIZE documentation that matches the exact use case scenario

    STEP 3 - ENHANCED TEMPLATE PRESENTATION TO USER:
    Show the template with this EXACT format:
    "Now configuring: [X of Y inputs]

    Task: {task_name}
    Input: {input_name} - {description}

    You can:
    - Accept these prefilled values (type 'accept')
    - Modify specific sections (provide your modifications)
    - Replace entirely (provide your complete configuration)

    Please review and confirm or modify the prefilled configuration:"

    STEP 4 - FALLBACK TO ORIGINAL TEMPLATE:
    If no documentation found or prefilling fails:
    - Show original empty template with standard format
    - Include note: "No documentation found for prefilling. Please provide your configuration."
    - Continue with existing workflow

    STEP 5 - COLLECT USER CONTENT:
    - Wait for the user to provide their response (accept/modify/replace)
    - Handle "accept" by using prefilled content
    - Handle modifications by merging with prefilled baseline
    - Handle complete replacement with user content
    - Do NOT proceed until the user provides content
    - NEVER use template content as default values without documentation analysis

    STEP 6 - PROCESS TEMPLATE INPUT:
    - Call collect_template_input(task_name, input_name, user_content)
    - Include documentation source metadata
    - Validates content format, checks required fields, uploads file
    - Returns file URL for use in rule structure

    TEMPLATE FORMAT HANDLING:
    - JSON: Must be valid JSON with proper brackets and quotes
    - TOML: Must follow TOML syntax with proper sections [section_name]
    - YAML: Must have correct indentation and structure
    - XML: Must be well-formed XML with proper tags

    VALIDATION RULES:
    - Format-specific syntax validation
    - Required field presence checking
    - Data type validation where applicable
    - Template structure compliance
    - Documentation standard compliance (when applicable)

    CRITICAL TEMPLATE RULES:
    - ALWAYS call get_template_guidance() for inputs with templates
    - ALWAYS analyze documentation before showing template to user
    - ALWAYS show the prefilled template (or original if no docs found) with exact presentation format
    - ALWAYS wait for the user to provide response (accept/modify/replace)
    - ALWAYS call collect_template_input() to process user content
    - NEVER use template content directly - always use documentation-enhanced or user-provided content
    - ALWAYS use returned file URLs in rule structure

    PROGRESS TRACKING:
    - Show "Now configuring: [X of Y inputs]" for user progress
    - Include clear task and input identification
    - Provide format-specific guidance and tips
    - Include documentation analysis results and source citations

    CONFIRMATION PROCESSING (Enhanced with Automatic Rule Updates):
    - Handles final confirmation of template content
    - Uploads files for FILE dataType inputs
    - Stores content in memory for non-FILE inputs
    - MANDATORY step before proceeding to next input
    - NEW: Automatically updates the rule with new input after processing
    - Skips confirmation if the user accepts the suggested template

    PROCESSING RULES (Enhanced):
    - FILE dataType: Upload content as file, return file URL
    - HTTP_CONFIG dataType: Upload content as file, return file URL
    - Non-FILE dataType: Store content in memory
    - Include metadata about confirmation and timestamp
    - NEW: Automatic rule update with new input data

    AUTOMATIC RULE UPDATE PROCESS:
    After successful input processing, this tool automatically:
    1. Fetches the current rule structure
    2. Adds the new input to spec.inputs
    3. Updates spec.inputsMeta__ with input metadata
    4. Calls create_rule() to save the updated rule
    5. Rule status will be auto-detected (DRAFT → collecting_inputs → READY_FOR_CREATION)

    UI DISPLAY REQUIREMENT:
    - The file URL must ALWAYS be displayed to the user in the UI, allowing the user to view or download the file directly.
    
    Args:
        rule_name: Descriptive name for the rule based on the user's use case. 
                   Note: Use the same rule name for all inputs that belong to this rule.
                   Example: rule_name = "MeaningfulRuleName"
        task_name: Name of the task this input belongs to

    ENHANCED FILE UPLOAD PROCESS:
    - Automatically detects file format from filename and content
    - Validates and fixes common formatting issues for JSON, YAML, TOML, CSV, XML
    - Accepts JSON arrays in various formats: raw, single-line, multi-line, or escaped (auto-formatted).
    - Normalizes CSV delimiters and whitespace
    - Reformats content with proper indentation/structure
    - No user preview required - validation happens automatically
    - Returns detailed validation results and file URL

    SUPPORTED INPUT FORMATS:
    - Raw JSON: {"key": "value"} or [{"key": "value"}]
    - Escaped JSON: "{"key": "value"}" 
    - Complex escaped: "[{"repository":"name","owner":"org"}]"
    - Standard strings for other formats (YAML, TOML, CSV, XML)

    AUTOMATIC FORMAT PROCESSING:
    - JSON: Detects escaped strings, unescapes, validates syntax, reformats with indentation
    - Raw JSON objects/arrays: Automatically converts to proper JSON string format
    - YAML: Validates structure, reformats with proper indentation  
    - TOML: Validates sections and key-value pairs, reformats
    - CSV: Detects delimiter, strips cell whitespace, normalizes format
    - XML: Validates well-formed structure
    - Other formats: Pass through as-is

    VALIDATION RESULTS:
    - Returns success/failure status with detailed error messages

    """
    INPUT COLLECTION OVERVIEW & RULE CREATION

    Prepare and present input collection overview before starting any input collection.

    MANDATORY FIRST STEP - INPUT OVERVIEW PROCESS (Enhanced):
    This tool MUST be called before collecting any inputs. It analyzes all selected tasks and presents a complete overview of what inputs will be needed.

    ENHANCED WITH AUTOMATIC RULE CREATION:
    After user confirms the input overview, this tool automatically creates the initial rule structure with selected tasks. The rule will be saved with DRAFT status and can be progressively updated as inputs are collected.

    **MANDATORY WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT - CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:**
    - AFTER user confirms the input overview, IMMEDIATELY call create_rule() with initial structure.
    - This call is MANDATORY and CANNOT be skipped or deferred.
    - The initial rule structure MUST be created before any input collection begins.
    - BLOCK all subsequent input collection if initial rule creation fails.
    - NEVER proceed to input collection without successful initial rule creation.
    - If create_rule() fails, STOP workflow and resolve the issue before continuing.
    - The rule creation establishes the foundation for progressive updates during input collection.


    **ENFORCEMENT STEPS:**
    1. Present overview to user
    2. Get user confirmation
    3. **IMMEDIATELY call create_rule() with initial structure that MUST INCLUDE inputs and inputsMeta__ sections WITH ACTUAL INPUT DATA - DO NOT LEAVE inputs and inputsMeta__ SECTION EMPTY - INPUTS AND INPUTSMETA__ ARE MANDATORY CORE COMPONENTS THAT MUST CONTAIN THE REQUIRED INPUT MAPPINGS - THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE - NO EXCEPTIONS**
    4. Verify rule creation success before proceeding
    5. Only then allow input collection to begin

    TASK-BY-TASK INPUT COLLECTION & VALIDATION (CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT):
    ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    MANDATORY WORKFLOW FOR EACH TASK:
    
    FOR EACH TASK in selected_tasks:
        STEP 1: Collect ALL inputs for current task
                - Use collect_template_input() for file/template inputs
                - Use collect_parameter_input() for parameter inputs
                - Wait for the current task inputs to be collected
        
        STEP 2: **MANDATORY EXECUTION** (CANNOT BE SKIPPED)
                ⛔ THIS STEP CANNOT BE SKIPPED ⛔
                - Call execute_task(task_name, collected_inputs_for_this_task, application_config)
                - This MUST happen IMMEDIATELY after all task inputs are collected
                - BLOCK progression if execution fails
                - If execution fails:
                  * Show execution errors to user
                  * Allow input correction
                  * Re-execute with corrected inputs
                  * Only proceed when execution succeeds
                - On success:
                  * Store the REAL outputs from this task
                  * Use these outputs as inputs for dependent tasks
                  * Display output files to user
        
        STEP 3: Move to next task ONLY after the task execution succeeds
                - Task Execution success = prerequisite for next task
                - No task can start input collection without previous task execution completing successfully
                - Use the REAL outputs from the executed task as inputs for dependent tasks

    ❌ PROHIBITED ACTIONS:
    - Collecting inputs for Task N+1 without executing Task N
    - Skipping execution "to save time"
    - Assuming execution will happen "later"
    - Moving to final rule creation without executing all tasks

    ✅ CORRECT WORKFLOW:
    Task1 Inputs → Execute Task1 → Show Results → Task2 Inputs → Execute Task2 → Show Results → Task3 Inputs → Execute Task3 → Show Results → Complete Rule

    ❌ WRONG WORKFLOW:
    Task1 Inputs → Task2 Inputs → Task3 Inputs → [Try to execute later]


    **SELECTIVE INPUT INCLUSION:**
    - DO NOT automatically include ALL task inputs in initial rule creation.
    - Only include inputs that are REQUIRED or explicitly needed for the user's use case.
    - Skip optional inputs unless user specifically requests them.
    - Additional inputs can be added later if needed during execution or refinement.

    **FAILURE HANDLING:**
    - If user confirms but create_rule() fails → STOP and fix issue.
    - If user declines → End workflow, no rule creation needed.
    - If create_rule() succeeds → Proceed to task-wise input collection and execution.
    - NEVER skip the create_rule() call after user confirmation.


    HANDLES DUPLICATE INPUT NAMES WITH TASK ALIASES (Preserved):
    - Creates unique identifiers for each task-alias-input combination.
    - Format: "{task_alias}.{input_name}" for uniqueness.
    - Prevents conflicts when multiple tasks have same input names or same task used multiple times.
    - Maintains clear mapping between task aliases and their specific inputs.
    - Task aliases should be simple, meaningful step indicators (e.g., "step1", "validation", "processing").

    OVERVIEW REQUIREMENTS (Preserved):
    1. Analyze ALL selected tasks with their aliases for input requirements.
    2. Categorize inputs: templates vs parameters.
    3. Create unique identifiers for each task-alias-input combination.
    4. Count total inputs needed.
    5. Present clear overview to user.
    6. Get user confirmation before proceeding.
    7. Return structured overview for systematic collection.
    8. NEW: Automatically create initial rule after user confirmation.

    OVERVIEW PRESENTATION FORMAT (Enhanced with Validation):
    
    INPUT COLLECTION OVERVIEW:

    I've analyzed your selected tasks. Here's what we need to configure:

    TASK 1: [TaskAlias] ([TaskName])
    ───────────────────────────────────
    Template Inputs:
    • [InputName] ([Format] file) - [Description]
      Unique ID: [TaskAlias.InputName]
    
    Parameter Inputs:
    • [InputName] ([DataType]) - [Description]
      Unique ID: [TaskAlias.InputName]
      Required: [Yes/No]
    
    ⚠️  EXECUTION CHECKPOINT: After collecting all Task 1 inputs, 
        execute_task() will be called to execute the task with real data before proceeding to Task 2.
    
    TASK 2: [TaskAlias] ([TaskName])
    ───────────────────────────────────
    [... similar structure ...]
    
    ⚠️  EXECUTION CHECKPOINT: After collecting all Task 2 inputs,
        execute_task() will be called to execute the task with real data before proceeding to Task 3.

    SUMMARY:
    - Total inputs needed: X
    - Template files: Y ([formats])
    - Parameter values: Z
    - Estimated time: ~[X] minutes
    - Execution checkpoints: [number of tasks]

    WORKFLOW:
    1. For each task in the rule:
        - Collect all required inputs for the task
        - Execute the task with real data using execute_task()
        - Mark the task as executed (✓)
        - Store REAL outputs for use by dependent tasks
    2. After all tasks are executed → proceed to final rule completion

    Ready to start task-by-task input collection with execution checkpoints?

    CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES:
    - ALWAYS call this tool first before any input collection.
    - NEVER start collecting inputs without user seeing overview.
    - NEVER proceed without user confirmation.
    - Create unique task_alias.input identifiers to avoid conflicts.
    - Show clear task-alias-input relationships to user.
    - NEW: Collect inputs task-by-task and execute each task immediately after collection.
    - NEW: Use REAL outputs from executed tasks as inputs for dependent tasks.
    - NEW: Create initial rule structure after user confirmation.

    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    - Input names: alphanumeric + underscore only (auto-sanitize with re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9_]', '_', name))
    - Collection order: Complete ALL inputs for each task one by one (Task 1 → execute Task 1 → Task 2 → execute Task 2 → Task 3 → execute Task 3)
    - Within each task: collect all inputs, then execute using 'execute_task()' to get real outputs before proceeding
    - If a task (e.g., Task 2) has input files or other inputs that depend on a previous task, use the REAL output from the executed previous task as the input. Do NOT generate sample data.
    - If the previous task has not been executed yet, execute it first to obtain real outputs.

    ARGS:
    - selected_tasks: list of dicts with 'task_name' and 'task_alias'
    Example:
    [
        {"task_name": "data_validation", "task_alias": "step1"},
        {"task_name": "data_processing", "task_alias": "step2"},
        {"task_name": "data_validation", "task_alias": "final_check"}
    ]

    Returns:
        Dict containing structured input overview and collection plan with unique identifiers,
        plus automatic rule creation capability after user confirmation, with explicit
        execution checkpoints for each task

    MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEP (Enhanced):

    This tool MUST be called after all inputs are collected but before final rule completion.
    It presents a comprehensive summary of all collected inputs for user verification.

    ENHANCED WITH AUTOMATIC RULE FINALIZATION:
    After user confirms verification, this tool can automatically finalize the rule by:
    1. Building complete I/O mapping based on task sequence and inputs
    2. Adding mandatory compliance outputs 
    3. Setting rule status to ACTIVE
    4. Completing the rule creation process

    HANDLES DUPLICATE INPUT NAMES WITH TASK ALIASES (Preserved):
    - Uses unique identifiers (TaskAlias.InputName) for each input
    - Properly maps each unique input to its specific task alias
    - Creates structured inputs for rule creation with unique names when needed
    - Maintains clear separation between inputs from different task instances

    VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS (Preserved):
    1. Show complete summary of ALL collected inputs with unique IDs
    2. Display both template files and parameter values
    3. Show file URLs for uploaded templates
    4. Present clear verification checklist
    5. Get explicit user confirmation
    6. Allow user to modify values if needed
    7. Prepare inputs for rule structure creation with proper task alias mapping
    8. NEW: Automatically finalize rule after user confirmation

    VERIFICATION PRESENTATION FORMAT (Preserved):
    "INPUT VERIFICATION SUMMARY:

    Please review all collected inputs before rule creation:

    TEMPLATE INPUTS (Uploaded Files):
    ✓ Task Input: [TaskAlias.InputName]
        Task: [TaskAlias] ([TaskName]) → Input: [InputName]
        Format: [Format]
        File: [filename]
        URL: [file_url]
        Size: [file_size] bytes

        Type: [DataType]
        Value: [user_value]
        Required: [Yes/No]
        Status: ✓ Set

    VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
    □ All required inputs collected
    □ Template files uploaded and validated
    □ Parameter values set and confirmed
    □ No missing or invalid inputs
    □ Ready for rule creation

    Are all these inputs correct?
    - Type 'yes' to proceed with rule creation
    - Type 'modify [TaskAlias.InputName]' to change a specific input
    - Type 'cancel' to abort rule creation"

    CRITICAL VERIFICATION RULES (Enhanced):
    - NEVER proceed to final rule creation without user verification
    - ALWAYS show complete input summary with unique identifiers
    - ALWAYS get explicit user confirmation
    - Allow input modifications using unique IDs
    - Validate completeness before approval
    - Prepare structured inputs for rule creation with proper task mapping

    """
    Execute a specific task with real data after collecting all required inputs.

    **This tool executes tasks with REAL data, not sample data.**
    If any input depends on a previous task's output and that output is not available,
    the dependent task(s) MUST be executed first to obtain the real output.

    ===============================================================================
    EXECUTION CONTEXT
    ===============================================================================
    - This tool MUST be called after collecting the inputs for a task.
    - Execution is sequential: execute Task 1 → then Task 2 → etc.
    - No task may proceed until its dependent tasks have been executed.
    - On execution failure, provide detailed error feedback.

    ===============================================================================
    DEPENDENCY & REAL DATA HANDLING
    ===============================================================================
    If a task requires input from a previous task (dataset, file, or structured output):

    1. **Use real task output when available**
        - If the dependent task was already executed and produced outputs:
            → Use those outputs as the input.
            → Do NOT generate synthetic/sample data.
            → Do NOT re-run the previous task unnecessarily.

    2. **If required previous task output does NOT exist**
        - The assistant MUST:
            - Explain *why* execution of the previous task is required.
            - Automatically execute the previous task (and any required tasks in the chain).
            - **After execution, display all execution results and outputs.**
            - NO user confirmation should be requested—only explanation.
            - Use the REAL output from the executed task as input.

    3. **If executing a required previous task fails**
        - The assistant MUST:
            - Explain clearly why the task failed.
            - Ask the user to provide the required input data manually.
        - User-provided data becomes the fallback input.

    4. **Only execute what is needed**
        - Execute ONLY the minimal set of tasks whose outputs are required.
        - **Every executed task must have its results shown to the user immediately.**

    ===============================================================================
    APPLICATION CONFIGURATION
    ===============================================================================
    Application credentials are REQUIRED if the task's appType is NOT 'nocredapp'.

    If the task requires application credentials (appType != 'nocredapp'):
    - Application config must be provided with:
        - appName: Application class name
        - appURL: Application URL (optional, can be empty string)
        - credentialType: Type of credentials
        - credentialValues: Actual credential key-value pairs
    - OR applicationId if using existing saved application

    If the task's appType is 'nocredapp':
    - Application configuration can be omitted (pass None or empty)
    - The system will automatically use the hardcoded nocredapp application structure:
      {
          "applicationType": "NoCredApp",
          "appURL": "",

    TASK EXECUTION FLOW
    ===============================================================================
    1. Receive task name and collected inputs
    2. Check if any input depends on previous task output
    3. For dependency inputs:
        a. Check if previous task output exists
        b. If not, execute previous task first
        c. Use real output as input value
    4. Prepare execution payload with real data
    5. Call task execution API
    6. Parse and return execution results with output file URLs

    Generate design notes preview for user confirmation before actual creation.

    ## DESIGN NOTES PREVIEW GENERATION

    This tool generates a complete Jupyter notebook structure as a dictionary for user review. The MCP will create the full notebook content with 7 standardized sections based on rule context and metadata, then return it for user confirmation.

    ## DESIGN NOTES TEMPLATE STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS

    The MCP should generate a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb format) with exactly 7 sections:

    ### SECTION 1: Evidence Details
    **DESCRIPTION:** System identification and rule purpose documentation

    **CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:**
    - Table with columns: System | Source of data | Frameworks | Purpose
    - System: {TARGET_SYSTEM_NAME} (all lowercase")
    - Source: Always 'compliancecow'
    - Frameworks: Always '-'
    - Purpose: Use rule's purpose from metadata
    - RecommendedEvidenceName: {RULE_OUTPUT_NAME} (use rule's primary compliance output, exclude LogFile)
    - Description: Use rule description from metadata
    - Reference: Include actual API documentation links that the rule uses (extract from task specifications, no placeholder values)

    **FORMAT:** Markdown cell with table and code blocks only

    ### SECTION 2: Define the System Specific Data (Extended Data Schema)
    **DESCRIPTION:** System-specific raw data structure definition with detailed breakdown

    **CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:**

    #### Step 2a: Inputs
    - Generate numbered list from rule's spec.inputs
    - Format: "{NUMBER}. **{INPUT_NAME}({INPUT_DATA_TYPE})** - {INPUT_DESCRIPTION}"
    - Include all inputs with their types and purposes

    #### Step 2b: API & Flow
    - Generate numbered list of API endpoints based on target system
    - Format: "{NUMBER}. {HTTP_METHOD} {URL} - {BRIEF_DESCRIPTION}"
    - Include only actual API endpoints that this specific rule uses for data collection
    - Extract from task specifications, not generic templates

    #### Step 2c: Define the Extended Schema
    - Generate large JSON code block with actual API response structure
    - Use system-specific field names and realistic data values
    - Include all fields that will be processed by the rule

    **FORMAT:** Markdown headers with detailed lists + large JSON code block

    ### SECTION 3: Define the Standard Schema
    **DESCRIPTION:** Standardized compliance data format documentation

    **CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:**
    - Header explaining standard schema purpose
    - JSON code block with complete standardized structure containing:
    * System: based on target system (lowercase)
    * Source: Always 'compliancecow'
    * Resource info: ResourceID, ResourceName, ResourceType, ResourceLocation, ResourceTags, ResourceURL
    * System-specific data fields based on actual rule output columns, if unavailable then generate based on rule details
    * Compliance fields: ValidationStatusCode, ValidationStatusNotes, ComplianceStatus, ComplianceStatusReason
    * Evaluation and action fields: EvaluatedTime, UserAction, ActionStatus, ActionResponseURL (UserAction, ActionStatus, ActionResponseURL are empty by default)

    #### Step 3a: Sample Data
    - Generate markdown table with ALL standard schema columns in same order - include all columns even if empty
    - Include three complete example rows with realistic, system-specific data
    - Use proper data formatting and realistic identifiers

    **FORMAT:** JSON code block + comprehensive markdown table

    ### SECTION 4: Describe the Compliance Taxonomy
    **DESCRIPTION:** Status codes and compliance definitions

    **CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:**
    - Table with columns: ValidationStatusCode | ValidationStatusNotes | ComplianceStatus | ComplianceStatusReason
    - ValidationStatusCode: **CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENT** - Rule-specific codes must strictly follow this exact format:
        * Each word must be exactly 3-4 characters long
        * Words must be separated by underscores (_)
        * Use ALL UPPERCASE letters
        * Create codes that directly relate to the rule's compliance purpose
        * Examples: CODE_OWN_HAS_PR_REV (code ownership has pull request review), REPO_SEC_SCAN_PASS (repository security scan passed), AUTH_MFA_ENBL (authentication multi-factor enabled)
        * **DO NOT** use generic codes like "PASS" or "FAIL" 
        * **DO NOT** exceed 4 characters per word
        * **DO NOT** use special characters other than underscores
        * Generate 4-6 different status codes covering various compliance scenarios
    - Detailed compliance reasons specific to the rule's purpose
    - Both COMPLIANT and NON_COMPLIANT scenarios

    **FORMAT:** Markdown cell with table

    ### SECTION 5: Calculation for Compliance Percentage and Status
    **DESCRIPTION:** Percentage calculations and status logic

    **CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:**
    - Header explaining compliance calculation methodology
    - Code cell with calculation logic:
    * TotalCount = Count of 'COMPLIANT' and 'NON_COMPLIANT' records
    * CompliantCount = Count of 'COMPLIANT' records
    * CompliancePCT = (CompliantCount / TotalCount) * 100
    * Status determination rules:
        - COMPLIANT: 100%
        - NON_COMPLIANT: 0% to less than 100%
        - NOT_DETERMINED: If no records are found

    **FORMAT:** Markdown header cell + Code cell with calculation logic

    ### SECTION 6: Describe (in words) the Remediation Steps for Non-Compliance
    **DESCRIPTION:** Non-compliance remediation procedures

    **CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:**
    - Can be "N/A" if no specific remediation steps apply
    - When applicable, provide:
    * Immediate Actions required
    * Short-term remediation steps
    * Long-term monitoring approaches
    * Responsible parties and timeframes
    - System-agnostic guidance that can be customized

    **FORMAT:** Markdown cell with detailed remediation procedures

    ### SECTION 7: Control Setup Details
    **DESCRIPTION:** Rule configuration and implementation details

    **CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:**
    - Table with two columns: Control Details | (Values)
    - Required fields (only these):
    * RuleName: Use actual rule name
    * PreRequisiteRuleNames: Default to 'N/A' or list dependencies
    * ExtendedSchemaRuleNames: Default to 'N/A' or list related rules
    * ApplicationClassName: Fetch all appType values from spec.tasks array, combine them, remove duplicates, and format as comma-separated values
    * PostSynthesizerName: Default to 'N/A' or specify if used

    **FORMAT:** Markdown table with control configuration details

    ## JUPYTER NOTEBOOK METADATA REQUIREMENTS

    - Include proper notebook metadata (colab, kernelspec, language_info)
    - Set nbformat: 4, nbformat_minor: 0
    - Use appropriate cell metadata with unique IDs for each section
    - Ensure proper markdown and code cell formatting

    ## MCP CONTENT POPULATION INSTRUCTIONS

    The MCP should extract the following information from the rule context:
    - Rule name, purpose, description from rule metadata
    - System name from appType (clean by removing connector suffixes like "-connector")
    - Task details from spec.tasks array
    - Input specifications from spec.inputs and spec.inputsMeta__
    - Output specifications from spec.outputsMeta__
    - Application connector information for control setup
    - API endpoints from task specifications (not generic placeholders)

    ## CONTENT GENERATION GUIDELINES

    - Use realistic, system-specific examples that can be customized later
    - Include comments in code sections indicating customization points
    - Provide system-agnostic content that applies broadly
    - Use consistent naming conventions throughout all sections
    - Extract actual API documentation links from task specifications
    - Generate ValidationStatusCodes that are specific to the rule's compliance purpose
    - Ensure all sample data reflects the actual system being monitored

    ## WORKFLOW

    1. MCP retrieves rule context from stored rule information
    2. MCP generates complete Jupyter notebook using template structure above
    3. MCP populates template with extracted rule metadata and calculated values
    4. MCP returns complete notebook structure as dictionary for user review
    5. User reviews and confirms the structure
    6. If approved, call create_design_notes() to actually save the notebook

    ## ARGS

    - rule_name: Name of the rule for which to generate design notes preview

    ## RETURNS

    Dict containing complete notebook structure for user review and confirmation
    """

    Analyze rule tasks and prepare application configuration requirements for execution.

    This tool helps users understand what applications are needed and whether they can
    share applications across multiple tasks.

    WHEN TO USE:
    - Before calling execute_rule() to understand application requirements
    - To identify if multiple tasks can share the same application
    - To determine if unique identifiers are needed when using different applications for same appType

    NOTE: This tool is optional. Rules with only 'nocredapp' tasks can be executed directly
    without any application configuration. Use this tool only when tasks require credentials.

    APPLICATION SHARING SCENARIOS (when applications are needed):
    1. **Shared Application**: User wants same credentials for all tasks of an appType
       - Single application config with basic appTags (just appType)
       - One application covers multiple tasks

    2. **Separate Applications**: User needs different credentials per task
       - Must add unique identifier key (e.g., "purpose") to task appTags
       - Each application config must include matching unique identifier

    3. **No Application Needed**: All tasks have 'nocredapp' appType
       - Skip application configuration entirely
       - Call execute_rule() with an empty applications list

    WORKFLOW:
    1. Call this tool with rule_name
    2. Review which tasks need applications (if any)
    3. If no tasks need applications (all nocredapp): Skip to step 6
    4. For tasks with same appType, decide: share or separate?
    5. If sharing: Provide one application config per appType
       If separate: Add unique identifiers and provide separate configs
    6. Call execute_rule() with configured applications (or empty list for nocredapp rules)

    Add a unique identifier key-value pair to a specific task's appTags.

    Use this when multiple tasks share the same appType but need DIFFERENT applications.
    The unique identifier allows the system to match each application to its specific task.

    WHEN TO USE:
    - After prepare_applications_for_execution() identifies tasks needing differentiation
    - When user chooses "separate applications" option for tasks with same appType
    - Before configuring separate applications for same appType tasks

    WORKFLOW:
    1. Call prepare_applications_for_execution() 
    2. If user chooses separate applications for an appType:
       - Call this tool for each task to add unique identifier

        Tool-based version of `fetch_rules_and_tasks_suggestions` for improved compatibility and prevention of duplicate rule creation.

        This tool serves as the initial step in the rule creation process. It helps determine whether the user's proposed use case matches any existing rule in the catalog.

        PURPOSE:
        - To analyze the user's use case and avoid duplicate rule creation by identifying the most suitable existing rule based on its name, description, and purpose.
        - **NEW: Check for partially developed rules in local system before allowing new rule creation**
        - **NEW: Present resumption options if incomplete rules are found to prevent duplicate work**

        WHEN TO USE:
        - As the first step before initiating a new rule creation process.
        - When the user wants to check if similar rules already exist by leveraging the Rules Suggestions API, instead of browsing the entire catalog manually.
        - When verifying if a suggested rule can be reused or adapted rather than creating one from scratch.
        - When checking for incomplete local rules that should be resumed instead of creating new ones.

        🚫 DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR:
        - Checking what rules are available in the ComplianceCow system.
        - This tool only works with the **rule catalog** (not the entire ComplianceCow system).
        - The catalog contains only rules that are published and available for reuse in the catalog.
        - For direct ComplianceCow system lookups, use dedicated system tools instead:
        - `fetch_cc_rule_by_name`
        - `fetch_cc_rule_by_id`
        
        MANDATORY STEP: CONTEXT SUMMARY
        - Before calling the rule catalog API, always rewrite the user’s raw requirement into a single-paragraph
        descriptive summary string (not bullet points, not verbatim input).
        - The summary must capture the essence of the requirement in clear, natural language.
        - This summary string is what will be passed to `fetch_rules_and_tasks_suggestions`.
        - Example:
            User input: "Use GitHub GraphQL API to fetch merged PRs and check if approvals >= 2"
            Summary: "The proposed rule validates compliance for GitHub Pull Requests by retrieving all merged PRs
            through the GitHub GraphQL API, checking whether the number of approvers meets a required threshold,
            and marking them as compliant or non-compliant."

        WHAT IT DOES:
        - Generates a concise summary string from the user's intent or requirements.
        - Calls the Rules Suggestions API with this summary string to retrieve a narrowed list of relevant rules.
        - Performs intelligent matching using metadata (name, description, purpose) from the suggested rules against the user-provided use case details.
        - Uses semantic pattern recognition to identify similar or related rules, even across different systems (e.g., AzureUserUnusedPermission vs SalesforceUserUnusedPermissions).
        - Analyzes the `readmeData` field from the `fetch_rule()` response to validate the rule's suitability for the user's use case.
        
        IF A MATCHING RULE IS FOUND:

        - Retrieves complete details via `fetch_rule()`.
        - If the readmeData field is available in the fetch_rule() response, Performs README-based validation using the `readmeData` field from the `fetch_rule()` response to assess its suitability for the user’s use case.
        - If suitable:
        - Returns the rule with full metadata, explanation, and the analysis report.
        - If not suitable:
        - Informs the user that the rule's README content does not align with the intended use case.
        - Prompts the user with clear next-step options:
            - "The rule's README content does not align with your use case. Please choose one of the following options:"
            - Customize the existing rule
                * When the user chooses “Customize the existing rule”, the system must automatically execute the existing rule before allowing any modifications.
                * This execution must happen immediately and without any user confirmation to load the current results and ensure that all changes—such as adding new tasks, altering task sequence, or updating input values—are applied on top of the most recent rule output.
            - Evaluate alternative matching rules
            - Proceed with new rule creation
        - Waits for the user's choice before proceeding.
        
        IF A SIMILAR RULE EXISTS FOR AN ALTERNATE TECHNOLOGY STACK:

        - Detects rules with the same logic but built for a different platform or system (e.g., AzureUserUnusedPermission for SalesforceUserUnusedPermissions)
        - If the readmeData field is available in the fetch_rule() response, Retrieves and analyzes the `readmeData` from the `fetch_rule()` response to compare the implementation details against the user's proposed use case
        - Based on the comparison:
            - If the README content matches or is mostly reusable, suggest using the existing rule structure and logic as a foundation to create a new rule tailored to the user's target system
            - If the README content does not match or is not suitable, clearly inform the user and recommend either modifying the logic significantly or proceeding with a completely new rule from scratch

        IF NO SUITABLE RULE IS FOUND:
        - Clearly informs the user that no relevant rule matches the proposed use case
        - Suggests continuing with new rule creation
        - Optionally highlights similar rules that can be used as a reference

        MANDATORY STEPS:
        README VALIDATION:
        - Always retrieve and analyze `readmeData` from `fetch_rule()`.
        - Ensure the rule's logic, behavior, and intended use align with the user's proposed use case.

        README ANALYSIS REPORT:
        - Generate a clear and concise report for each `readmeData` analysis that classifies the result as a full match, partially reusable, or not aligned.
        - Present this report to the user for review.

        USER CONFIRMATION BEFORE PROCEEDING:
        When analyzing a README file:
        - If no relevant rule matches the proposed use case, or if the README is deemed unsuitable, the tool must pause and request explicit user confirmation before proceeding further.
        - The tool should:
        - Clearly inform the user that no matching rule was found or the README is not appropriate.
        - Suggest creating a new rule as the next step.
        - Optionally recommend similar existing rules that can serve as references to help the user craft the new rule.

        ITERATE UNTIL MATCH:
        - Repeat the above steps until a suitable rule is found or all options are exhausted.

        CROSS-PLATFORM RULE HANDLING:
        - For rules from a different stack:
        - If reusable: suggest customization
        - If not reusable: recommend new rule creation

        Returns:
        - A single rule object with full metadata and verified README match — if an exact match is found
        - A similar rule suggestion with customization options — if a cross-system match is found (e.g., AzureUserUnusedPermission vs SalesforceUserUnusedPermissions)
        - A message indicating no suitable rule found — with next steps and guidance to create a new rule

        INPUT–OUTPUT STRUCTURE RESOLUTION (NEW – REQUIRED BEHAVIOR)
        ============================================================================
        - **Before creating rule these steps must be done.**
        - After identifying the required inputs for the task:
            1. Check whether any input corresponds to, or depends on,
            the output structure of an existing task in the rule.
            2. If such a relationship exists:
                - The assistant MUST explain clearly why execution is needed
                ("The input <X> depends on the actual output structure of Task <Y>...")
                - Automatically execute ONLY the minimal tasks needed to obtain
                the real output structure.
                - These executions MUST use the execute_task() tool with real data.
            3. Use the real output structure (not a placeholder, not a template)
            to:
                - Construct the correct input schema for the new task
                - Ensure mapping accuracy and avoid invalid input formats
            4. If execution fails:
                - Explain why execution failed
                - Ask the user to provide manual sample data
                - Use the provided sample data for structure inference

        INTENTION-BASED OUTPUT CHAINING:
        - ANALYZE output purpose: Is this meant for direct user consumption or further processing?
        - ASSESS completion level: Does this output fulfill the user's end goal or serve as a stepping stone?
        - EVALUATE consolidation needs: Are multiple outputs meant to be combined for complete picture?
        - DETERMINE transformation requirements: Does raw output need formatting for usability?

        WORKFLOW GAP DETECTION:
        - IDENTIFY outputs that represent partial solutions to user problems
        - DETECT outputs that split information requiring reunification
        - RECOGNIZE outputs that extract data without presenting insights
        - FLAG outputs that validate without providing actionable summaries

        COMPLETION INTENTION MATCHING:
        - SUGGEST tasks that transform intermediate outputs into final deliverables
        - RECOMMEND tasks that consolidate split information into unified reports
        - PROPOSE tasks that add analysis layer to raw validation results
        - ENSURE suggested tasks align with user's stated end goals

        IMPORTANT (MANDATORY BEHAVIOR):
        If the requested task is not found with the user's specification, the system MUST:
        1. Prompt the user to choose how to proceed including the below option.
        - Option: Create task development Ticket.
        2. Wait for the user's response before taking any further action.
        3. If the user chooses to create a task development ticket, call `create_support_ticket()` via the MCP tool, collecting the required input details from the user before submitting.

        Args:
        task_name: The name of the task for which to retrieve details

        Returns:
            A dictionary containing the complete task information if found,

        COMPLETE RULE CREATION PROCESS WITH PROGRESSIVE SAVING:

        This tool now handles both initial rule creation and progressive updates during the rule creation workflow.
        It intelligently detects the completion status and sets appropriate metadata automatically.
        It returns the URL to view the rule in the UI once it is created display the URL in chat.

        ENHANCED FOR PROGRESSIVE SAVING:
        - Automatically detects rule completion status based on rule structure content
        - Determines if rule is in-progress, ready for execution, or needs more inputs
        - Handles both initial creation and updates of existing rules
        - No additional parameters needed - analyzes rule structure intelligently
        - Maintains all existing validation and creation logic
        - Preserves all original docstring instructions and requirements

        CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - INPUTS META:
        - `spec.inputsMeta__` is **mandatory** for all rules, and rule creation cannot proceed without it.

        AUTOMATIC STATUS DETECTION:
        - DRAFT: Rule has tasks but missing inputs or I/O mapping (5-85% complete)
        - READY_FOR_CREATION: All inputs collected but I/O mapping incomplete (85% complete)
        - ACTIVE: Complete rule with tasks, inputs, and I/O mapping (100% complete)

        RULE COMPLETION ANALYSIS:
        - Checks if tasks are defined in spec.tasks
        - Validates that `spec.inputsMeta__` exists
        - Counts collected inputs in spec.inputs vs spec.inputsMeta__
        - Validates I/O mapping presence and completeness in spec.ioMap
        - Analyzes outputsMeta__ for mandatory compliance outputs
        - Sets appropriate status and creation phase automatically

        PROGRESSIVE CREATION PHASES (Auto-detected):
        1. "initialized" - Basic rule info provided (5%)
        2. "tasks_selected" - Tasks chosen and defined (25%) 
        3. "collecting_inputs" - Individual inputs being collected (25-85%)
        4. "inputs_collected" - All inputs gathered, ready for I/O mapping (85%)
        5. "completed" - Final rule creation complete with I/O mapping (100%)

        ORIGINAL REQUIREMENTS MAINTAINED:
        - All existing validation rules still apply
        - Task alias validation in I/O mappings preserved
        - Primary app type determination logic maintained
        - Mandatory output requirements (CompliancePCT_, ComplianceStatus_, LogFile)
        - YAML preview and user confirmation workflow preserved
        - All existing error handling and validation checks

        CRITICAL: This tool should be called:
        1. After planning phase to create initial rule structure
        2. After each input collection to update rule progressively
        3. After input verification to finalize rule with I/O mapping
        4. Rule status and progress automatically detected each time
        5. **When the user selects “Customize the existing rule”, the system must immediately execute the existing rule before allowing any modifications.
            This execution must occur automatically and without requesting user confirmation.
            However, the system must collect all required inputs from the user that are necessary to run this execution.
            After execution is complete, all customizations—including adding new tasks, modifying task order, or updating input values—must be applied on top of the freshly executed rule output, 
            ensuring the user always customizes the most up-to-date version of the rule.**

        PRE-CREATION REQUIREMENTS (Original):
        1. `spec.inputsMeta__` must be defined and contain valid input definitions
        2. All inputs must be collected through systematic workflow
        3. User must provide input overview confirmation  
        4. All template inputs processed via collect_template_input()
        5. All parameter values collected and verified
        6. User must confirm all input values before rule creation
        7. Primary application type must be determined
        8. Rule structure must be shown to user in YAML format for final approval

        STEP 1 - PRIMARY APPLICATION TYPE DETERMINATION (Preserved):
        Before creating rule structure, determine primary application type:
        1. Collect all unique appType tags from selected tasks
        2. Filter out 'nocredapp' (dummy placeholder value)
        3. Handle app type selection:
            - If only one valid appType: Use automatically
            - If multiple valid appTypes: Ask user to choose primary application
            - If no valid appTypes (all were nocredapp): Use 'generic' as default
        4. Set primary app type for appType, annotateType, and app fields (single value arrays)

        STEP 2 - RULE STRUCTURE WITH TASK ALIASES (Preserved):
        ```yaml
            apiVersion: rule.policycow.live/v1alpha1
            kind: rule

                - '*.Output.LogFile:=validation.Output.LogFile'  # Log file from last task
        ```

        STEP 3 - I/O MAPPING WITH TASK ALIASES (Preserved):
        - Use golang-style assignment: destination:=source
        - 3-part structure: PLACE.DIRECTION.ATTRIBUTE_NAME
        - Always use EXACT attribute names from task specifications
        - Use meaningful task aliases instead of generic names
        - Ensure sequential data flow: Rule → Task1 → Task2 → Rule
        - Mandatory compliance outputs from last task

        STEP 4 - inputsMeta__ Cleanup:
        In spec.inputsMeta__, retain only the entries whose keys exist in spec.inputs. Remove any fields in spec.inputsMeta__ that are not present in spec.inputs.

        If the user's request indicates modifying, updating, editing, customizing, adding, or removing rule elements (tasks, inputs, outputs, or sequence), the tool must NOT immediately execute the rule.

        Instead, follow this process:

        1. Identify exactly which inputs, tasks, or configurations the user wants to modify.
        2. Determine whether the requested modification affects any downstream tasks, dependent inputs, or output mappings.
        - If the modification affects other tasks, dependencies, or the rule's final output:
            a. Explain to the user WHY execution is required (e.g., “The input you are changing affects Task X and Task Y, so the rule must be re-executed to generate updated dependent outputs.”).
            b. Before execution, collect all mandatory parameters needed by execute_rule() — do not assume defaults.
            c. Execute the rule.
            d. Call fetch_execution_progress() and display outputs in this format:
                    - TaskName: [task_name]
                    - Files: [list of files]
            e. Ask: “View file contents? (yes/no)”
                - If yes, fetch_output_file() for each selected file and display contents.
        - If the modification does NOT affect dependent tasks:
            - Return the rule metadata and allow the user to modify without executing.

        If the user's request is only to view, inspect, read, or fetch the rule, do NOT execute and simply return the rule metadata.

        """
        Tool-based version of `get_rules_summary` for improved compatibility and prevention of duplicate rule creation.

        This tool serves as the initial step in the rule creation process. It helps determine whether the user's proposed use case matches any existing rule in the catalog.

        PURPOSE:
        - To analyze the user's use case and avoid duplicate rule creation by identifying the most suitable existing rule based on its name, description, and purpose.
        - **NEW: Check for partially developed rules in local system before allowing new rule creation**
        - **NEW: Present resumption options if incomplete rules are found to prevent duplicate work**

        WHEN TO USE:
        - As the first step before initiating a new rule creation process
        - When the user wants to retrieve and review all available rules in the **catalog**
        - When verifying if a similar rule already exists that can be reused or customized
        - **NEW: When checking for incomplete local rules that should be resumed instead of creating new ones**

        🚫 DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR:
        - Checking what rules are available in the ComplianceCow system.
        - This tool only works with the **rule catalog** (not the entire ComplianceCow system).
        - The catalog contains only rules that are published and available for reuse in the catalog.
        - For direct ComplianceCow system lookups, use dedicated system tools instead:
        - `fetch_cc_rule_by_name`
        - `fetch_cc_rule_by_id`

        WHAT IT DOES:
        - Retrieves the full list of rules from the catalog with simplified metadata (name, purpose, description)
        - Performs intelligent matching using metadata (name, description, purpose) with user-provided use case details
        - Uses semantic pattern recognition to find similar rules, even across different systems (e.g., AzureUserUnusedPermission vs SalesforceUserUnusedPermissions)

        IF A MATCHING RULE IS FOUND:

        - Retrieves complete details via `fetch_rule()`.
        - If the readmeData field is available in the fetch_rule() response, Performs README-based validation using the `readmeData` field from the `fetch_rule()` response to assess its suitability for the user’s use case.
        - If suitable:
        - Returns the rule with full metadata, explanation, and the analysis report.
        - If not suitable:
        - Informs the user that the rule's README content does not align with the intended use case.
        - Prompts the user with clear next-step options:
            - "The rule's README content does not align with your use case. Please choose one of the following options:"
            - Customize the existing rule
                * When the user chooses “Customize the existing rule”, the system must automatically execute the existing rule before allowing any modifications.
                * This execution must happen immediately and without any user confirmation to load the current results and ensure that all changes—such as adding new tasks, altering task sequence, or updating input values—are applied on top of the most recent rule output.
            - Evaluate alternative matching rules
            - Proceed with new rule creation
        - Waits for the user's choice before proceeding.
        
        IF A SIMILAR RULE EXISTS FOR AN ALTERNATE TECHNOLOGY STACK:

        - Detects rules with the same logic but built for a different platform or system (e.g., AzureUserUnusedPermission for SalesforceUserUnusedPermissions)
        - If the readmeData field is available in the fetch_rule() response, Retrieves and analyzes the `readmeData` from the `fetch_rule()` response to compare the implementation details against the user's proposed use case
        - Based on the comparison:
            - If the README content matches or is mostly reusable, suggest using the existing rule structure and logic as a foundation to create a new rule tailored to the user's target system
            - If the README content does not match or is not suitable, clearly inform the user and recommend either modifying the logic significantly or proceeding with a completely new rule from scratch

        IF NO SUITABLE RULE IS FOUND:
        - Clearly informs the user that no relevant rule matches the proposed use case
        - Suggests continuing with new rule creation
        - Optionally highlights similar rules that can be used as a reference

        MANDATORY STEPS:
        README VALIDATION:
        - Always retrieve and analyze `readmeData` from `fetch_rule()`.
        - Ensure the rule's logic, behavior, and intended use align with the user's proposed use case.

        - Generate a clear and concise report for each `readmeData` analysis that classifies the result as a full match, partially reusable, or not aligned.
        - Present this report to the user for review.

        USER CONFIRMATION BEFORE PROCEEDING:
        When analyzing a README file:
        - If no relevant rule matches the proposed use case, or if the README is deemed unsuitable, the tool must pause and request explicit user confirmation before proceeding further.
        - The tool should:
        - Clearly inform the user that no matching rule was found or the README is not appropriate.
        - Suggest creating a new rule as the next step.
        - Optionally recommend similar existing rules that can serve as references to help the user craft the new rule.

        ITERATE UNTIL MATCH:
        - Repeat the above steps until a suitable rule is found or all options are exhausted.

        CROSS-PLATFORM RULE HANDLING:
        - For rules from a different stack:
        - If reusable: suggest customization
        - If not reusable: recommend new rule creation

        Returns:
        - A single rule object with full metadata and verified README match — if an exact match is found
        - A similar rule suggestion with customization options — if a cross-system match is found (e.g., AzureUserUnusedPermission vs SalesforceUserUnusedPermissions)
        - A message indicating no suitable rule found — with next steps and guidance to create a new rule

        RULE EXECUTION WORKFLOW:

        **PARAMETER VALIDATION:
            Before starting any execution workflow, the tool should validate that required parameters
            (rule_name, rule_inputs) are present. Applications are optional and only needed for tasks
            that require credentials.**

        PREREQUISITE STEPS:
        0. **MANDATORY: Check rule status to ensure rule is fully developed before execution**
        1. User chooses to execute rule after creation
        2. Extract unique appTags from selected tasks (excluding 'nocredapp')
        3. APPLICATION CONFIGURATION (OPTIONAL - only for tasks requiring credentials):
            For tasks that need application credentials:
            - Fetch available applications via get_applications_for_tag().
            - Present them to the user for manual selection.
            - User decides to:
                a. Use an existing application, or
                b. Run with new credentials (not persisted or saved as an application).
            - Proceed after user confirmation.

            Note: Rules with only 'nocredapp' tasks can be executed without any application configuration.

        APPLICATION-TASK MATCHING LOGIC (when applications are needed):
        ================================
        - Applications are matched to tasks via 'appTags' labels
        - Tasks with 'nocredapp' appType do not require application configuration
        - **SHARED APPLICATION SUPPORT**: A single application CAN be used for multiple tasks
        if the user confirms they want to share the same credentials
        - When multiple tasks share the same appType AND require DIFFERENT applications,
        unique identifier key-value pairs MUST be added to distinguish them

        MATCHING SCENARIOS:
        1. **One application per task**: Each task has unique appType → straightforward matching
        2. **Shared application**: Multiple tasks share same appType AND same application
        - User confirms: "Use same application for all [appType] tasks? (yes/no)"
        - If yes: Single application covers all matching tasks
        - Application appTags should match the common appType
        3. **Multiple applications for same appType**: Different credentials needed for different tasks
        - Add unique identifier key (e.g., "purpose", "sourceSystem") to distinguish
        - Each application's appTags must include the unique identifier matching its target task

        APPLICATION CONFIGURATION FORMAT (when needed):
        For existing application (can be shared across multiple tasks):
        ```json
            [
                {
                    "applicationType": "[application_class_name from fetch_applications(appType)]",
                    "applicationId": "[Actual application ID chosen by user]",
                    "appTags": "[Complete object from rule spec.tasks[].appTags]"
                }
            ]
        ```

        For new credentials:
        ```json
            [
                {
                    "applicationType": "[application_class_name from fetch_applications(appType)]",
                    "appURL": "[Application URL from user (optional - can be empty string)]",
                    "credentialType": "[User chosen credential type]",
                    "credentialValues": {
                        "[User provided credentials]"
                    },
                    "appTags": "[Complete object from rule spec.tasks[].appTags]"
                }
            ]
        ```

        WORKFLOW FOR MULTIPLE TASKS WITH SAME APPTYPE:
        1. Detect tasks sharing same appType (excluding 'nocredapp')
        2. Ask user: "Tasks [task1, task2] both require [appType]. Options:
        a) Use SAME application/credentials for all tasks
        b) Use DIFFERENT applications (requires unique identifiers)"
        3. If SAME: User provides one application config with basic appTags
        4. If DIFFERENT:
        - Prompt for unique identifier key (e.g., "purpose", "sourceSystem")
        - User provides separate application configs with unique identifier values
        - Update task appTags with matching unique identifiers

        4. Build applications array (if needed) → get user confirmation
        5. Additional Inputs (optional):
            - Ask user: "Do you want to specify a date range for this execution?"
            - From Date (format: YYYY-MM-DD) - optional
            - To Date (format: YYYY-MM-DD) - optional
        6. Final confirmation → execute rule
        7. If execution starts successfully → call fetch_execution_progress()
        8. Rule Output File Display Process:
            a. Extract task outputs from execution results
            b. MANDATORY: Show output in this format:
                - TaskName: [task_name]
                - Files: [list of files]
            c. Ask: "View file contents? (yes/no)"
            d. If yes: Call fetch_output_file() for each requested file
            e. Display results with formatting
        9. Rule Publication (optional):
        - Ask user: "Do you want to publish this rule to make it available in ComplianceCow system? (yes/no)"
        - If yes: Call publish_rule() to publish the rule
        - If no: End workflow
        10. Modify rule such as add/delete tasks (optional):
        - Ask user: "Do you want to modify this rule? (yes/no)"
        - If yes: Call publish_rule() to publish the rule
        - If no: End workflow

        UI DISPLAY REQUIREMENT:
        - The file URL must ALWAYS be displayed to the user in the UI, allowing the user to view or download the file directly.

        CRITICAL: rule_inputs MUST be the complete spec.inputsMeta__ objects with ALL original fields
        (name, description, dataType, repeated, allowedValues, required, defaultValue, format, showField,
        explanation) plus the 'value' field. DO NOT send trimmed objects with only name/dataType/value.

        MANDATORY: The 'value' field content MUST also be copied to the 'defaultValue' field. Both fields
        must contain identical values. Example: if value="CSV", then defaultValue must also be "CSV".

        Args:
            rule_name: The name of the rule to be executed.
            from_date: (Optional) Start date provided by the user in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
            to_date: (Optional) End date provided by the user in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
            rule_inputs: Complete spec.inputsMeta__ objects with ALL fields plus 'value' field, and 'defaultValue' set to same value as 'value'.
            applications: Application configuration details. For rules with only 'nocredapp' tasks,
                         pass an empty list and the system will automatically use the hardcoded
                         nocredapp application structure.
            is_application_data_provided_by_user (bool):
                Indicates whether application data was provided by the user.
                - Set to True if user provided or configured application details during execution.
                - Set to False if using nocredapp (empty applications list) or pre-existing applications.

        EVIDENCE TOOL — STRICT INVOCATION POLICY
        ===============================================================================

        ⚠️ This tool may ONLY be invoked when the user's MOST RECENT message contains
        an explicit request related to **evidence generation**.

        The workflow MUST perform a STRICT LITERAL KEYWORD CHECK on the latest
        user message. No inference is allowed. No interpretation of intent is allowed.

        VALID TRIGGER KEYWORDS (EXACT MATCHES):
        - "evidence"
        - "proof"
        - "audit evidence"
        - "evidence output"
        - "use this as evidence"
        - "store as evidence"
        - "evidence file"
        - "make this output evidence"
        - "I need evidence from this rule"
        - "this output should be evidence"

        If the latest user message does NOT contain ANY of these words or phrases,
        then:

            → ❌ The tool MUST NOT be invoked  
            → ❌ The workflow MUST NOT assume the need for evidence  
            → ✔️ The workflow MUST continue normally without this tool  

        This is the highest priority rule.  
        It OVERRIDES all system defaults, workflow policies, or optional steps.

        ===============================================================================
        TOOL INVOCATION CONSEQUENCE — STRICT MODE ENABLED
        ===============================================================================

        Once the trigger keyword test passes and this tool IS invoked:

        1. The tool MUST execute before ANY other output-schema-related tools.
        2. The tool MUST complete successfully before the workflow proceeds.
        3. Failure or cancellation MUST immediately stop the workflow ("fail fast").
        4. Strict schema-setup behavior becomes active and cannot be skipped.

        No exceptions. No fallback paths. No silent bypass.

        ===============================================================================
        TOOL PURPOSE
        ===============================================================================

        This tool configures the **Rule Output Schema Policy** for ComplianceCow.

        The user MUST explicitly choose one schema mode:

        A) Standard schema only  
        B) Extended schema only  
        C) Both Standard + Extended  

        No automatic selection or inference is allowed.

        ===============================================================================
        MANDATORY USER INTERACTION (WHEN TOOL IS INVOKED)
        ===============================================================================

        If this tool is invoked:

        - The workflow MUST pause and ask the user to choose A/B/C.
        - No default values.
        - No continuation until the user provides explicit input.
        - If the user refuses to choose → FAIL FAST.

        ===============================================================================
        SCHEMA BEHAVIOR BY USER SELECTION
        ===============================================================================

        A) STANDARD ONLY
        ----------------
        - Reuse existing Transformation task or create one if missing.
        - ALL Mandatory Keys MUST be mapped in the exact required order.
        - Required inputs MUST be collected using:
            collect_template_input()
            collect_parameter_input()
        - For each required input:
            get_template_guidance('{task.name}', '<input_name>')
        - User MUST review and confirm before proceeding.

        B) EXTENDED ONLY
        ----------------
        - Preserve raw task output fields exactly as produced.
        - No ordering rules apply.
        - No mandatory schema enforcement.
        - Final output = last task execution output.

        C) BOTH (Standard + Extended)
        -----------------------------
        - Perform ALL Standard steps (A).
        - Add exactly ONE extended output:
            ExtendedData_<filename>
        - Map the last task output into ExtendedData_<filename>.
        - Prevent duplicate extended output nodes.
        - Require full validation + explicit user confirmation.

        ===============================================================================
        MANDATORY FIELDS (STRICT ORDER)
        ===============================================================================

        The Standard Schema MUST include the following keys in this EXACT order:

        1. System
        2. Source
        3. ResourceID
        4. ResourceName
        5. ResourceType
        6. ResourceLocation
        7. ResourceTags
        8. <Additional Keys based on user needs>
        9. ValidationStatusCode
        10. ValidationStatusNotes
        11. ComplianceStatus
        12. ComplianceStatusReason
        13. EvaluatedTime
        14. UserAction
        15. ActionStatus
        16. ActionResponseURL

        Case-sensitive. No renaming. No omission.

        ===============================================================================
        VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS
        ===============================================================================

        When the tool is invoked and before proceeding:

        - ALL mandatory keys MUST be mapped.
        - ALL collected inputs MUST be validated.
        - ALL guidance MUST be retrieved.
        - The user MUST confirm the schema configuration.
        - A Mermaid or D3 visualization MUST be generated immediately.
        - No downstream tool may execute before the chart is shown.

        ===============================================================================
        EXECUTION ORDER REQUIREMENT
        ===============================================================================

        If this tool completes successfully, the NEXT tool MUST be:

            prepare_input_collection_overview()

        No other tool may run in between.

        ===============================================================================
        SUMMARY OF THE GOLDEN RULE
        ===============================================================================

        **The ONLY condition that allows calling this tool is an explicit evidence
        keyword in the user's latest message. Without that, do NOT call the tool.**

            UPDATE RULE — REQUIRED BEHAVIOR
            --------------------------------------------------------------------
            You MUST update the rule object by modifying the dictionary provided
            in the variable `rule_structure`. All regenerated values (name,
            purpose, description) MUST be written directly back into
            rule_structure["meta"] before returning.

            RULE UPDATE LOGIC
            --------------------------------------------------------------------
            When modifying an existing rule (adding, removing, or updating
            tasks), always regenerate the complete rule object internally using
            the same logic defined in create_rule(), but call update_rule() —
            never create_rule().

            UPDATE STRATEGY
            --------------------------------------------------------------------
            1. You are allowed to modify ONLY these fields, and ONLY when they
            truly change based on user modifications:
            - rule_structure["meta"]["name"]
            - rule_structure["meta"]["purpose"]
            - rule_structure["meta"]["description"]

            2. All other fields in rule_structure MUST remain unchanged unless
            the user explicitly modified them.

            3. Never perform partial patches. Always rewrite the full final
            rule in rule_structure and return the entire updated object.

        RULE METADATA HANDLING:
            --------------------------------------------------------------------
            - meta.name: 
                * NEVER auto-rename the rule during updates
                * Only rename if user explicitly provides a new name
                * Preserve existing rule name in all update scenarios
            
            - meta.purpose:
                * Preserve existing purpose unless user explicitly provides new purpose
                * Do not auto-regenerate based on task changes
            
            - meta.description:
                * Preserve existing description unless user explicitly provides new description
                * Do not auto-regenerate based on task changes
            
            USER-INITIATED RENAME ONLY:
            - If user explicitly says "rename the rule to X" or "change the rule name to X"
            - Then and only then update meta.name with the user-provided name
            - Otherwise, always preserve the existing rule name

            OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
            --------------------------------------------------------------------
            - Modify rule_structure IN PLACE.
            - Always return the entire updated rule_structure object.
            - Do not return anything else.
            - The updated rule_structure will be passed to update_rule() MCP tool.

        Tool-based version of `fetch_rules_and_tasks_suggestions` for improved compatibility and prevention of duplicate rule creation.

        This tool serves as the initial step in the rule creation process. It helps determine whether the user's proposed use case matches any existing rule in the catalog.

        PURPOSE:
        - To analyze the user's use case and avoid duplicate rule creation by identifying the most suitable existing rule based on its name, description, and purpose.
        - **NEW: Check for partially developed rules in local system before allowing new rule creation**
        - **NEW: Present resumption options if incomplete rules are found to prevent duplicate work**

        WHEN TO USE:
        - As the first step before initiating a new rule creation process.
        - When the user wants to check if similar rules already exist by leveraging the Rules Suggestions API, instead of browsing the entire catalog manually.
        - When verifying if a suggested rule can be reused or adapted rather than creating one from scratch.
        - When checking for incomplete local rules that should be resumed instead of creating new ones.

        🚫 DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR:
        - Checking what rules are available in the ComplianceCow system.
        - This tool only works with the **rule catalog** (not the entire ComplianceCow system).
        - The catalog contains only rules that are published and available for reuse in the catalog.
        - For direct ComplianceCow system lookups, use dedicated system tools instead:
        - `fetch_cc_rule_by_name`
        - `fetch_cc_rule_by_id`
        
        MANDATORY STEP: CONTEXT SUMMARY
        - Before calling the rule catalog API, always rewrite the user’s raw requirement into a single-paragraph
        descriptive summary string (not bullet points, not verbatim input).
        - The summary must capture the essence of the requirement in clear, natural language.
        - This summary string is what will be passed to `fetch_rules_and_tasks_suggestions`.
        - Example:
            User input: "Use GitHub GraphQL API to fetch merged PRs and check if approvals >= 2"
            Summary: "The proposed rule validates compliance for GitHub Pull Requests by retrieving all merged PRs
            through the GitHub GraphQL API, checking whether the number of approvers meets a required threshold,
            and marking them as compliant or non-compliant."

        WHAT IT DOES:
        - Generates a concise summary string from the user's intent or requirements.
        - Calls the Rules Suggestions API with this summary string to retrieve a narrowed list of relevant rules.
        - Performs intelligent matching using metadata (name, description, purpose) from the suggested rules against the user-provided use case details.
        - Uses semantic pattern recognition to identify similar or related rules, even across different systems (e.g., AzureUserUnusedPermission vs SalesforceUserUnusedPermissions).
        - Analyzes the `readmeData` field from the `fetch_rule()` response to validate the rule's suitability for the user's use case.
        
        IF A MATCHING RULE IS FOUND:

        - Retrieves complete details via `fetch_rule()`.
        - If the readmeData field is available in the fetch_rule() response, Performs README-based validation using the `readmeData` field from the `fetch_rule()` response to assess its suitability for the user’s use case.
        - If suitable:
        - Returns the rule with full metadata, explanation, and the analysis report.
        - If not suitable:
        - Informs the user that the rule's README content does not align with the intended use case.
        - Prompts the user with clear next-step options:
            - "The rule's README content does not align with your use case. Please choose one of the following options:"
            - Customize the existing rule
            - Evaluate alternative matching rules
            - Proceed with new rule creation
        - Waits for the user's choice before proceeding.
        
        IF A SIMILAR RULE EXISTS FOR AN ALTERNATE TECHNOLOGY STACK:

        - Detects rules with the same logic but built for a different platform or system (e.g., AzureUserUnusedPermission for SalesforceUserUnusedPermissions)
        - If the readmeData field is available in the fetch_rule() response, Retrieves and analyzes the `readmeData` from the `fetch_rule()` response to compare the implementation details against the user's proposed use case
        - Based on the comparison:
            - If the README content matches or is mostly reusable, suggest using the existing rule structure and logic as a foundation to create a new rule tailored to the user's target system
            - If the README content does not match or is not suitable, clearly inform the user and recommend either modifying the logic significantly or proceeding with a completely new rule from scratch

        IF NO SUITABLE RULE IS FOUND:
        - Clearly informs the user that no relevant rule matches the proposed use case
        - Suggests continuing with new rule creation
        - Optionally highlights similar rules that can be used as a reference

        MANDATORY STEPS:
        README VALIDATION:
        - Always retrieve and analyze `readmeData` from `fetch_rule()`.
        - Ensure the rule's logic, behavior, and intended use align with the user's proposed use case.

        README ANALYSIS REPORT:
        - Generate a clear and concise report for each `readmeData` analysis that classifies the result as a full match, partially reusable, or not aligned.
        - Present this report to the user for review.

        USER CONFIRMATION BEFORE PROCEEDING:
        When analyzing a README file:
        - If no relevant rule matches the proposed use case, or if the README is deemed unsuitable, the tool must pause and request explicit user confirmation before proceeding further.
        - The tool should:
        - Clearly inform the user that no matching rule was found or the README is not appropriate.
        - Suggest creating a new rule as the next step.
        - Optionally recommend similar existing rules that can serve as references to help the user craft the new rule.

        ITERATE UNTIL MATCH:
        - Repeat the above steps until a suitable rule is found or all options are exhausted.

        CROSS-PLATFORM RULE HANDLING:
        - For rules from a different stack:
        - If reusable: suggest customization
        - If not reusable: recommend new rule creation

        Returns:
        - A single rule object with full metadata and verified README match — if an exact match is found
        - A similar rule suggestion with customization options — if a cross-system match is found (e.g., AzureUserUnusedPermission vs SalesforceUserUnusedPermissions)
        - A message indicating no suitable rule found — with next steps and guidance to create a new rule

        - Use this information for accurate task matching and rule structure creation

        INTENTION-BASED OUTPUT CHAINING:
        - ANALYZE output purpose: Is this meant for direct user consumption or further processing?
        - ASSESS completion level: Does this output fulfill the user's end goal or serve as a stepping stone?
        - EVALUATE consolidation needs: Are multiple outputs meant to be combined for complete picture?
        - DETERMINE transformation requirements: Does raw output need formatting for usability?

        WORKFLOW GAP DETECTION:

        COMPLETE RULE CREATION PROCESS WITH PROGRESSIVE SAVING:

        This tool now handles both initial rule creation and progressive updates during the rule creation workflow.
        It intelligently detects the completion status and sets appropriate metadata automatically.
        It returns the URL to view the rule in the UI once it is created display the URL in chat.

        ENHANCED FOR PROGRESSIVE SAVING:
        - Automatically detects rule completion status based on rule structure content
        - Determines if rule is in-progress, ready for execution, or needs more inputs
        - Handles both initial creation and updates of existing rules
        - No additional parameters needed - analyzes rule structure intelligently
        - Maintains all existing validation and creation logic
        - Preserves all original docstring instructions and requirements

        CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - INPUTS META:
        - `spec.inputsMeta__` is **mandatory** for all rules, and rule creation cannot proceed without it.

        AUTOMATIC STATUS DETECTION:
        - DRAFT: Rule has tasks but missing inputs or I/O mapping (5-85% complete)
        - READY_FOR_CREATION: All inputs collected but I/O mapping incomplete (85% complete)
        - ACTIVE: Complete rule with tasks, inputs, and I/O mapping (100% complete)

        RULE COMPLETION ANALYSIS:
        - Checks if tasks are defined in spec.tasks
        - Validates that `spec.inputsMeta__` exists
        - Counts collected inputs in spec.inputs vs spec.inputsMeta__
        - Validates I/O mapping presence and completeness in spec.ioMap
        - Analyzes outputsMeta__ for mandatory compliance outputs
        - Sets appropriate status and creation phase automatically

        PROGRESSIVE CREATION PHASES (Auto-detected):
        1. "initialized" - Basic rule info provided (5%)
        2. "tasks_selected" - Tasks chosen and defined (25%) 
        3. "collecting_inputs" - Individual inputs being collected (25-85%)
        4. "inputs_collected" - All inputs gathered, ready for I/O mapping (85%)
        5. "completed" - Final rule creation complete with I/O mapping (100%)

        ORIGINAL REQUIREMENTS MAINTAINED:
        - All existing validation rules still apply
        - Task alias validation in I/O mappings preserved
        - Primary app type determination logic maintained
        - Mandatory output requirements (CompliancePCT_, ComplianceStatus_, LogFile)
        - YAML preview and user confirmation workflow preserved
        - All existing error handling and validation checks

        CRITICAL: This tool should be called:
        1. After planning phase to create initial rule structure
        2. After each input collection to update rule progressively
        3. After input verification to finalize rule with I/O mapping
        4. Rule status and progress automatically detected each time

        PRE-CREATION REQUIREMENTS (Original):
        1. `spec.inputsMeta__` must be defined and contain valid input definitions
        2. All inputs must be collected through systematic workflow
        3. User must provide input overview confirmation  
        4. All template inputs processed via collect_template_input()
        5. All parameter values collected and verified
        6. User must confirm all input values before rule creation
        7. Primary application type must be determined
        8. Rule structure must be shown to user in YAML format for final approval

        STEP 1 - PRIMARY APPLICATION TYPE DETERMINATION (Preserved):
        Before creating rule structure, determine primary application type:
        1. Collect all unique appType tags from selected tasks
        2. Filter out 'nocredapp' (dummy placeholder value)
        3. Handle app type selection:
            - If only one valid appType: Use automatically
            - If multiple valid appTypes: Ask user to choose primary application
            - If no valid appTypes (all were nocredapp): Use 'generic' as default
        4. Set primary app type for appType, annotateType, and app fields (single value arrays)

        STEP 2 - RULE STRUCTURE WITH TASK ALIASES (Preserved):

        ```

        STEP 3 - I/O MAPPING WITH TASK ALIASES (Preserved):
        - Use golang-style assignment: destination:=source
        - 3-part structure: PLACE.DIRECTION.ATTRIBUTE_NAME
        - Always use EXACT attribute names from task specifications
        - Use meaningful task aliases instead of generic names
        - Ensure sequential data flow: Rule → Task1 → Task2 → Rule
        - Mandatory compliance outputs from last task

        STEP 4 - inputsMeta__ Cleanup:
        In spec.inputsMeta__, retain only the entries whose keys exist in spec.inputs. Remove any fields in spec.inputsMeta__ that are not present in spec.inputs.

        VALIDATION CHECKLIST (Preserved):
        □ Rule structure validation against schema
        □ Task alias validation in I/O mappings
        □ Primary app type determination
        □ Input/output specifications validation
        □ Mandatory compliance outputs present
        □ Sequential data flow in I/O mappings

        Tool-based version of `get_rules_summary` for improved compatibility and prevention of duplicate rule creation.

        This tool serves as the initial step in the rule creation process. It helps determine whether the user's proposed use case matches any existing rule in the catalog.

        PURPOSE:
        - To analyze the user's use case and avoid duplicate rule creation by identifying the most suitable existing rule based on its name, description, and purpose.
        - **NEW: Check for partially developed rules in local system before allowing new rule creation**
        - **NEW: Present resumption options if incomplete rules are found to prevent duplicate work**

        WHEN TO USE:
        - As the first step before initiating a new rule creation process
        - When the user wants to retrieve and review all available rules in the **catalog**
        - When verifying if a similar rule already exists that can be reused or customized
        - **NEW: When checking for incomplete local rules that should be resumed instead of creating new ones**

        🚫 DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR:
        - Checking what rules are available in the ComplianceCow system.
        - This tool only works with the **rule catalog** (not the entire ComplianceCow system).
        - The catalog contains only rules that are published and available for reuse in the catalog.
        - For direct ComplianceCow system lookups, use dedicated system tools instead:
        - `fetch_cc_rule_by_name`
        - `fetch_cc_rule_by_id`

        WHAT IT DOES:
        - Retrieves the full list of rules from the catalog with simplified metadata (name, purpose, description)
        - Performs intelligent matching using metadata (name, description, purpose) with user-provided use case details
        - Uses semantic pattern recognition to find similar rules, even across different systems (e.g., AzureUserUnusedPermission vs SalesforceUserUnusedPermissions)

        IF A MATCHING RULE IS FOUND:

        - Retrieves complete details via `fetch_rule()`.
        - If the readmeData field is available in the fetch_rule() response, Performs README-based validation using the `readmeData` field from the `fetch_rule()` response to assess its suitability for the user’s use case.
        - If suitable:
        - Returns the rule with full metadata, explanation, and the analysis report.
        - If not suitable:
        - Informs the user that the rule's README content does not align with the intended use case.
        - Prompts the user with clear next-step options:
            - "The rule's README content does not align with your use case. Please choose one of the following options:"
            - Customize the existing rule
            - Evaluate alternative matching rules
            - Proceed with new rule creation
        - Waits for the user's choice before proceeding.
        
        IF A SIMILAR RULE EXISTS FOR AN ALTERNATE TECHNOLOGY STACK:

        - Detects rules with the same logic but built for a different platform or system (e.g., AzureUserUnusedPermission for SalesforceUserUnusedPermissions)
        - If the readmeData field is available in the fetch_rule() response, Retrieves and analyzes the `readmeData` from the `fetch_rule()` response to compare the implementation details against the user's proposed use case
        - Based on the comparison:
            - If the README content matches or is mostly reusable, suggest using the existing rule structure and logic as a foundation to create a new rule tailored to the user's target system
            - If the README content does not match or is not suitable, clearly inform the user and recommend either modifying the logic significantly or proceeding with a completely new rule from scratch

        IF NO SUITABLE RULE IS FOUND:
        - Clearly informs the user that no relevant rule matches the proposed use case
        - Suggests continuing with new rule creation
        - Optionally highlights similar rules that can be used as a reference

        MANDATORY STEPS:
        README VALIDATION:
        - Always retrieve and analyze `readmeData` from `fetch_rule()`.
        - Ensure the rule's logic, behavior, and intended use align with the user's proposed use case.

        README ANALYSIS REPORT:
        - Generate a clear and concise report for each `readmeData` analysis that classifies the result as a full match, partially reusable, or not aligned.
        - Present this report to the user for review.

        USER CONFIRMATION BEFORE PROCEEDING:
        When analyzing a README file:
        - If no relevant rule matches the proposed use case, or if the README is deemed unsuitable, the tool must pause and request explicit user confirmation before proceeding further.
        - The tool should:
        - Clearly inform the user that no matching rule was found or the README is not appropriate.
        - Suggest creating a new rule as the next step.
        - Optionally recommend similar existing rules that can serve as references to help the user craft the new rule.

        ITERATE UNTIL MATCH:
        - Repeat the above steps until a suitable rule is found or all options are exhausted.

        CROSS-PLATFORM RULE HANDLING:
        - For rules from a different stack:
        - If reusable: suggest customization
        - If not reusable: recommend new rule creation

        Returns:
        - A single rule object with full metadata and verified README match — if an exact match is found
        - A similar rule suggestion with customization options — if a cross-system match is found (e.g., AzureUserUnusedPermission vs SalesforceUserUnusedPermissions)
        - A message indicating no suitable rule found — with next steps and guidance to create a new rule

        RULE EXECUTION WORKFLOW:

        PREREQUISITE STEPS:
        0. **MANDATORY: Check rule status to ensure rule is fully developed before execution**
        1. User chooses to execute rule after creation
        2. Extract unique appTags from selected tasks (excluding 'nocredapp')
        3. APPLICATION CONFIGURATION (OPTIONAL - only for tasks requiring credentials):
            For tasks that need application credentials:
            - Fetch available applications via get_applications_for_tag().
            - Present them to the user for manual selection.
            - User decides to:
                a. Use an existing application, or
                b. Run with new credentials (not persisted or saved as an application).
            - Proceed after user confirmation.

            Note: Rules with only 'nocredapp' tasks can be executed without any application configuration.

        APPLICATION-TASK MATCHING LOGIC (when applications are needed):
        ================================
        - Applications are matched to tasks via 'appTags' labels
        - Tasks with 'nocredapp' appType do not require application configuration
        - **SHARED APPLICATION SUPPORT**: A single application CAN be used for multiple tasks
          if the user confirms they want to share the same credentials
        - When multiple tasks share the same appType AND require DIFFERENT applications,
          unique identifier key-value pairs MUST be added to distinguish them

        MATCHING SCENARIOS:
        1. **One application per task**: Each task has unique appType → straightforward matching
        2. **Shared application**: Multiple tasks share same appType AND same application
           - User confirms: "Use same application for all [appType] tasks? (yes/no)"
           - If yes: Single application covers all matching tasks
           - Application appTags should match the common appType
        3. **Multiple applications for same appType**: Different credentials needed for different tasks
           - Add unique identifier key (e.g., "purpose", "sourceSystem") to distinguish
           - Each application's appTags must include the unique identifier matching its target task

        APPLICATION CONFIGURATION FORMAT (when needed):
        For existing application (can be shared across multiple tasks):
            ```json
            [
                {
                    "applicationType": "[application_class_name from fetch_applications(appType)]",
                    "applicationId": "[Actual application ID chosen by user]",
                    "appTags": "[Complete object from rule spec.tasks[].appTags]"
                }
            ]
            ```

        For new credentials:
            ```json
            [
                {
                    "applicationType": "[application_class_name from fetch_applications(appType)]",
                    "appURL": "[Application URL from user (optional - can be empty string)]",
                    "credentialType": "[User chosen credential type]",
                    "credentialValues": {
                        "[User provided credentials]"
                    },
                    "appTags": "[Complete object from rule spec.tasks[].appTags]"
                }
            ]
            ```

        WORKFLOW FOR MULTIPLE TASKS WITH SAME APPTYPE:
        1. Detect tasks sharing same appType (excluding 'nocredapp')
        2. Ask user: "Tasks [task1, task2] both require [appType]. Options:
           a) Use SAME application/credentials for all tasks
           b) Use DIFFERENT applications (requires unique identifiers)"
        3. If SAME: User provides one application config with basic appTags
        4. If DIFFERENT:
           - Prompt for unique identifier key (e.g., "purpose", "sourceSystem")
           - User provides separate application configs with unique identifier values
           - Update task appTags with matching unique identifiers

        4. Build applications array (if needed) → get user confirmation
        5. Additional Inputs (optional):
            - Ask user: "Do you want to specify a date range for this execution?"
            - From Date (format: YYYY-MM-DD) - optional
            - To Date (format: YYYY-MM-DD) - optional
        6. Final confirmation → execute rule
        7. If execution starts successfully → call fetch_execution_progress()
        8. Rule Output File Display Process:
            a. Extract task outputs from execution results
            b. MANDATORY: Show output in this format:
                - TaskName: [task_name]
                - Files: [list of files]
            c. Ask: "View file contents? (yes/no)"
            d. If yes: Call fetch_output_file() for each requested file
            e. Display results with formatting
        9. Rule Publication (optional):
        - Ask user: "Do you want to publish this rule to make it available in ComplianceCow system? (yes/no)"
        - If yes: Call publish_rule() to publish the rule
        - If no: End workflow

        UI DISPLAY REQUIREMENT:
        - The file URL must ALWAYS be displayed to the user in the UI, allowing the user to view or download the file directly.

        CRITICAL: rule_inputs MUST be the complete spec.inputsMeta__ objects with ALL original fields
        (name, description, dataType, repeated, allowedValues, required, defaultValue, format, showField,
        explanation) plus the 'value' field. DO NOT send trimmed objects with only name/dataType/value.

        MANDATORY: The 'value' field content MUST also be copied to the 'defaultValue' field. Both fields
        must contain identical values. Example: if value="CSV", then defaultValue must also be "CSV".

        Args:
            rule_name: The name of the rule to be executed.
            from_date: (Optional) Start date provided by the user in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
            to_date: (Optional) End date provided by the user in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
            rule_inputs: Complete spec.inputsMeta__ objects with ALL fields plus 'value' field, and 'defaultValue' set to same value as 'value'.
            applications: Application configuration details. For rules with only 'nocredapp' tasks,
                         pass an empty list and the system will automatically use the hardcoded
                         nocredapp application structure.
            is_application_data_provided_by_user (bool):
                Indicates whether application data was provided by the user.
                - Set to True if user provided or configured application details during execution.

        PREREQUISITE — MUST RUN FIRST (NON-SKIPPABLE)
        This tool is a hard prerequisite and MUST be executed successfully before the `prepare_input_collection_overview()` tool (and any downstream rule-creation or evaluation steps). 
        If this tool has not run or did not complete, the workflow MUST fail fast with an explicit error.
        
        PURPOSE
        Establish the rule's output schema policy for ComplianceCow and apply any required transformations. In ComplianceCow, we maintain a standard format for storing evidence records. The user MUST choose one of the following rule output options:

        1) Standard schema only (ComplianceCow structured response fields)
        2) Extended schema only (all fields from the source response)
        3) Both standard + extended

        USER PROMPT (MANDATORY — NEVER SKIPPABLE)
        The workflow MUST always pause and explicitly prompt the user before proceeding.  
        This step CANNOT be bypassed, defaulted, auto-selected, or inferred.  
        If the user has not actively selected one of (a), (b), or (c), this tool MUST fail fast with a clear error message and stop execution.  

        VALIDATION & ENFORCEMENT
        - This tool is NON-SKIPPABLE. If not executed, or if the user does not provide an explicit choice (a/b/c), the workflow MUST stop immediately with an error.  
        - No implicit defaults, assumptions, or auto-selections are allowed.  
        - Mandatory Key mapping rules still apply if Standard schema is chosen.

        BEHAVIOR BY SELECTION

        A) If user selects STANDARD ONLY:
        - If the pipeline already ends with a Transformation task, reuse the existing Transformation task instead of appending a new one.
        - Otherwise, append a Transformation task at the END of the selected task pipeline.
        - In the Transformation task, map ALL Mandatory Keys (listed below).
        - Values for these keys MUST be taken from the pipeline's input file(s) and/or upstream task outputs, following the Deeper Analysis Rules.
        - Continue collecting inputs for the Transformation task using:
            `collect_template_input()` or `collect_parameter_input()`.
        - For each input that requires user guidance, call:
            `get_template_guidance('{task.name}', '<input_name>')`
        to display the expected input format to the user.
        - Ask the user to review and confirm OR edit the configuration before proceeding.
        - Do not proceed unless all Mandatory Keys are mapped and the configuration is confirmed (fail fast with guidance).

        B) If user selects EXTENDED ONLY:
        - The Extended schema is a NON-STANDARD structure. It preserves the raw fields from the source response without enforcing ComplianceCow's standard schema format or mandatory key order.
        - Use the LAST task's output directly as the Extended schema output.
        - No mandatory field ordering or schema enforcement is applied — the structure is kept as-is for completeness and traceability.

        C) If user selects BOTH:
        - Perform all steps from (A) to create the Standard schema:
        * Append a Transformation task at the END of the selected task pipeline.
        * Map ALL Mandatory Keys in the exact required order.
        * Include <AdditionalKeysBasedOnUseCase> as needed for compliance.
        - Also add the Extended schema as a NON-STANDARD structure:
        * Create exactly ONE output field named: ExtendedData_<filename>.
            <filename> MUST be determinable from the use case (e.g., source, resource, or input artifact name).
        * Map the SAME LAST task output that is used as the input to the Transformation task into ExtendedData_<filename>.
        * Do NOT create duplicate extended outputs (for example, do not add both
            ExtendedData_JSONToCSV and ConvertedCSVFile if they contain the same data).
            Only ExtendedData_<filename> must exist.
        - Continue collecting inputs for the Transformation task using:
            collect_template_input() or collect_parameter_input().
        - For each input that requires user guidance, call:
            get_template_guidance('{task.name}', '<input_name>')
        to display the expected input format to the user.
        - Ask the user to review and confirm OR edit the configuration before proceeding.
        - Do not proceed unless:
        * All Mandatory Keys are mapped and validated in order
        * Configuration is confirmed by the user

        DEEPER ANALYSIS RULES
        - Always extract and map the core Mandatory Keys required for compliance.
        - For <AdditionalKeysBasedOnUseCase>, determine the minimal required fields based on the user's specific use case and map them under the Standard schema.
        - If additional fields are critical for the use case, map them explicitly into the Standard schema.
        - If fields are non-critical but useful, preserve them under `ExtendedData_<filename>`.
        - If MCP cannot store certain fields, the tool MUST explain the omission clearly to the user before proceeding and request confirmation if needed.

        MANDATORY KEYS (MUST ALWAYS BE MAPPED — IN THIS EXACT ORDER)
        - System
        - Source
        - ResourceID
        - ResourceName
        - ResourceType
        - ResourceLocation
        - ResourceTags
        - <Important Keys Based On User's Use Case>
            (for example: fields from the response file such as user_id, username, email,
            license_type, assigned_date, last_login_date, last_activity_date)
        - ValidationStatusCode
        - ValidationStatusNotes
        - ComplianceStatus
        - ComplianceStatusReason
        - EvaluatedTime
        - UserAction
        - ActionStatus
        - ActionResponseURL

        VALIDATION & ENFORCEMENT
        - This tool is NON-SKIPPABLE. If not executed, or if any Mandatory Key mapping is missing for the chosen Standard schema path, the workflow MUST stop with an error.
        - Key names are case-sensitive and MUST NOT be renamed.
        - The tool MUST persist the chosen option and mappings so that downstream tools consume a consistent schema contract.
        - The workflow MUST NOT proceed to `prepare_input_collection_overview()` until:
            * Inputs are collected via `collect_template_input()` or `collect_parameter_input()`
            * `get_template_guidance()` has been used for each input needing guidance
            * The user has confirmed or edited the configuration
            * All Mandatory Keys are mapped and validated in order
        - Mandatory, a JS chart (Mermaid/D3) MUST be generated to visualize the rule's I/O field structure. The chart must be displayed in this chat immediately after user input, and no further processing is allowed until this step is completed.

        EXECUTION ORDER GUARANTEE
        On success, and ONLY after input collection and configuration confirmation,
        the next tool to run MUST be `prepare_input_collection_overview()`.

        CVE RULE CREATION INSTRUCTIONS:
            - First get the CVEs from this tool.
            - If the user requests a CVE that is not available from this tool, use `execute_shell_command`
            to fetch the CVE data and remediation details.

        When creating a rule for a specific CVE:
            1. Briefly summarize the CVE, including the affected component, impact, and severity.
            2. Present all valid remediations.
            3. After listing the remediations, show the plan for each remediation: which APIs will be used, which fields will be checked, and how that remediation will be verified in the target system.
            4. Create the rule to determine both whether the target resource is affected and whether any valid remediation is already in place.
            5. Check version, deployment pattern, settings or configuration, and any other relevant signal that can confirm exposure or remediation coverage.
            6. Only if remediation differs by deployment pattern or any other condition, first identify that condition and then verify only the applicable remediation path. Example: for ingress-nginx, Helm-managed and manually deployed setups can require different remediation checks.
            7. If the resource is affected, clearly state why it is affected and what remediation is required. If the resource is not affected because a valid remediation is already applied, clearly state which remediation is in place.
            8. Include all checks performed so the remediation decision is traceable.
            9. Use standard schema and include evidence columns `ClusterName`, `NameSpace`, and `CVE`, plus extra columns `ChecksPerformed`, `MatchedRemediation`, `AffectedReason`, `Remediation`, and `PatchContent`.
            10. If a remediation can be applied as a patch, include the exact patch content in `PatchContent` so it can be used with `kubectl patch <resource-type> <resource-name> -p '<patch-json-or-yaml>'`.
